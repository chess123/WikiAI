It has 83 ayahs and is one of the Meccan surahs, although some scholars maintain that verse 12 is from the Medinan period.[1] The name of the chapter comes from the two letters of the first verse of the chapter,[2] which has caused much scholarly debate, and which Tafsir al-Jalalayn, a Sunni tafsir, interprets by saying, "God knows best what He means by these."[3] Y? S?n is also one of the names of the Prophet Muhammad, as reported in a saying of Ali, "I heard the Messenger of God say, 'Verily God has named me by seven names in the Quran: Muhammad [3:144; 33:40; 47:2; 48:29], Ahmad [61:6], T? H? [20:1], Y? S?n [36:1], thou enwrapped [al-Muzammil; 73:1], thou who art covered [al-Mudaththir; 74:1], and servant of God [?Abd All?h; 72:19].'"[4] The surah focuses on establishing the Qur'an as a divine source, and it warns of the fate of those that mock God's revelations and are stubborn. The surah tells of the punishments that plagued past generations of nonbelievers as a warning to present and future generations. Additionally, the surah reiterates God's sovereignty as exemplified by His creations through signs from nature. The surah ends with arguments in favor of the existence of Resurrection and God's sovereign power. Contents 1 Heart of the Quran 2 Sections and themes 3 References 4 External links Heart of the Quran[edit] It has been proposed that Y??-S?n is the "heart of the Quran".[5] The meaning of “the heart” has been the basis of much scholarly discussion. The eloquence of this surah is traditionally regarded as representative of the miraculous nature of the Qur'an.[6] It presents the essential themes of the Qur'an, such as the sovereignty of God, the unlimited power of God as exemplified by His creations, Paradise, the ultimate punishment of nonbelievers, resurrection, the struggle of believers against polytheists and nonbelievers, and the reassurance that the believers are on the right path, among others.[7] Y? S?n presents the message of the Qur'an in an efficient and powerful manner, with its quick and rhythmic verses. Sections and themes[edit] There are three main themes of Y??-S?n: Tawhid, the oneness of God; Risala, that Muhammad is a messenger sent by God to guide His creations through divine revelation; and the reality of Akhirah, the Last Judgment.[8] 36:70 “This is a revelation, an illuminating Qur’an to warn anyone who is truly alive, so that God’s verdict may be passed against the disbelievers.” [9] The surah repeatedly warns of the consequences of not believing in the legitimacy or the revelation of Muhammad, and encourages believers to remain steadfast and resist the mockery, oppression, and ridicule they receive from polytheists and nonbelievers.[10] The arguments arise in three forms: a historical parable, a reflection on the order in the universe, and lastly a discussion of resurrection and human accountability.[10] The chapter begins with an affirmation of the legitimacy of Muhammad.[8] For example, verses 2-6, "By the wise Qur'an, you [Muhammad] are truly one of the messengers sent of a straight path, with a revelation from the Almighty, the Lord of Mercy, to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, and so they are unaware."[11] The first passage, verses 1-12, focuses primarily with promoting the Qur'an as guidance and establishing that it is God's sovereign choice who will believe and who will not. It is stated that regardless of a warning, the nonbelievers cannot be swayed to believe. 36:10 "It is all the same to them whether you warn them or not: they will not believe."[11] Surah Y??-S?n then proceeds to tell the tale of the messengers that were sent to warn nonbelievers, but who were rejected.[8] Although the messengers proclaimed to be legitimate, they were accused of being ordinary men by the nonbelievers. 36:15-17 "They said, 'Truly, we are messengers to you,' but they answered, 'You are only men like ourselves. The Lord of Mercy has sent nothing; you are just lying."[12] Upon his death, the third messenger entered Paradise, and lamented the fate of the nonbelievers. 36:26 "He was told, 'Enter the Garden,' so he said, 'If only my people knew how my Lord has forgiven me and set me among the highly honored."[13] This surah is meant to warn the nonbelievers of the consequences of their denial, but verse 36:30 implies that regardless, the nonbelievers will not see. "Alas for human beings! Whenever a messenger comes to them they ridicule him."[14] Ultimately, it is God's will who will be blind and who will see.[8] The following passage addresses the signs of God's supremacy over nature.[8] This is presented by the sign of revived land, the sign of day and night, the sign of the arc and the flood, and the sign of the sudden blast that arrives on the day of judgement. 36:33-37 The sign of revived land follows: There is a sign for them in this lifeless earth: We give it life and We produce grains from it for them to eat; We have put gardens of date palms and grapes in the earth, and We have made water gush out of it so that they could eat its fruit. It is not their own hands that made all this. How can they not give thanks? Glory be to Him who created all the pairs of things that the earth produces, as well as themselves and other things they do not know about.[13] The disbelievers do not recognize God’s power in the natural world, although He is the one Creator.[8] The surah further addresses what will happen to those who reject the right path presented by Muhammad and refuse to believe in God. On the last day, the day of reckoning, the nonbelievers will be held accountable for their actions and will be punished accordingly.[8] God warned the nonbelievers of Satan, and yet Satan led them astray. 36:60-63 "Children of Adam, did I not command you not to serve Satan, for he was your sworn enemy, but to serve Me? This is the straight path. He has led great numbers of you astray. Did you not use your reason? So this is the fire that you were warned against."[15] Although God warned them against following Satan, the nonbelievers were deaf, and so now they will suffer the consequences of their ill judgements. 36:63 "So this is the Fire that you were warned against. Enter it today, because you went on ignoring [my commands]."[15] The surah proceeds to address the clear nature of the revelation and assure that Muhammad is a legitimate prophet.[8] 36:69 states, "We have not taught the Prophet poetry, nor could he ever have been a poet." [9] Y??-S?n concludes by reaffirming God’s sovereignty and absolute power. 36:82-83 "When He wills something to be, His way is to say, 'Be'—and it is! So glory be to Him in whose Hand lies control over all things. It is to Him that you will all be brought back. [9] It is to God, the one Creator who holds everything in His hands, that everything returns. The closing passage is absolute and powerful and carries an essential message of the Qur'an.

Contents 1 History 2 Animals 3 Notes 4 External links History[edit] Main article: Wetheriggs Pottery The pottery was established about 1855 as a brick, tile, and pipe works to supply building materials. In the 1860s when it was taken over by John Schofield and Margaret Thorburn, it started producing housewares. After World War II a market developed for decorative ware, and the pottery became a tourist destination.[1] The pottery was scheduled as a National Industrial Monument in 1973, and at the time was the only steam-powered pottery remaining in the United Kingdom.[1] It was restored in 1994, with the steam equipment restored in 1995 by Fred Dibnah. The original beehive kiln is still standing, and is now a showcase for pottery that has been produced at the site over the years.[2] The Animal Rescue Center was opened on the historic Wetheriggs Pottery site in 2006. In 2008, because of its work in the attempted re-creation of the Cumberland Pig, its work with rare poultry breeds, and work with native newts, it became the Wetheriggs Animal Rescue and Conservation Centre. It was re-branded to Wetheriggs Zoo and Animal Sanctuary in 2011. Towards the end of 2014, the rescue centre was forced to relocate all the animals to a new home at Thorpe Farm Centre near Barnard Castle in County Durham. The move came about when the site they were residing on was put up for sale.[2] Animals[edit] The centre is home to alpacas, sheep, goats, cows, horses, chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, pigs, donkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, mice, gerbils, hedgehogs, budgies, quail, skunks, tarantulas, snakes, lizards and more. Currently some of the exotic animals the centre cares for are off display to visitors. The centre depends on the generosity of the general public to keep running. Visitors to the site pay admission into the site and all the money goes directly to the animal welfare work. People can also donate money directly to the centre.

The S.72 was a three-engine, high-wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear. Designed as a heavy bomber, the prototype was first flown in 1934 powered by three 410 kW (550 hp) Alfa Romeo licence-built Bristol Pegasus radial engines.

After being demonstrated in China in 1935 the prototype was handed over to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as a gift. Six more aircraft were ordered by the Chinese and assembled in China. It is presumed that all the aircraft were destroyed in Japanese air raids in 1937.

In the 1920s a school was opened at Artigas' house in Paraguay.[3] During the War of the Triple Alliance, in which Uruguay was the smallest member of the coalition at war with Paraguay, soldiers of both countries fought each other in the major battles of Jataí, Tuyutí and Curupaity. Both countries were founding members of the Mercosur, and both are full members of the Rio Group, the Latin Union, the Association of Spanish Language Academies, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the Union of South American Nations, the URUPABOL, and of the Cairns Group. Both countries are sometimes grouped together because they both share the suffix "Guay". There are Paraguayan citizens living and working in Uruguay, as well as some Uruguayan expatriates in Paraguay. Both countries also consider each other as interesting tourist destinations.

Contents 1 Construction 2 Operation 3 The Crossley Engine 4 Multiple unit working 5 Other Modifications 6 End of Career 7 Names 8 Status list 9 Preservation 10 References 11 External links Construction[edit] In the early 1950s the Western Australian Government Railways placed the largest single Australian order for diesel locomotives, when it ordered 48 2-Do-2 locomotives from Beyer, Peacock and Company and Metropolitan-Vickers. All were delivered between 1954 and 1956.[1] Operation[edit] XA1402 at Forrestfield Yard in August 1987 The X class revolutionised operations on the WAGR. Their light axle load (around 12t) meant they could travel on all lines. The dual cab arrangement eliminated the need for turning. They were quickly allocated to express passenger trains including the Albany Express, Australind, Kalgoorlie Express and The Westland. The Crossley Engine[edit] At the time of construction, the HST-Vee8 was an untested concept, though the engine itself was an evolution of a design used successfully in patrol boats during World War Two.[2] Failures commenced within weeks of the first locomotives being unveiled. It was only the skill of staff at WAGR's Midland Railway Workshops that saved the day. In their early days, availability was less than for steam. The engines used exhaust pulse pressure charging and developed 1,200 horsepower (895 kW) at 625 rpm, though in 1981 they were down-rated to 875 hp@600rpm. There were no valves, and inlet and exhaust were via ports in the cylinder walls. The engines burnt oil, had underfed bearings, vibrated and popped heads and pistons, and suffered from ring scuffing for most of their lives. It was only the engineering excellence, and perseverance of Midland Railway Workshops staff that kept the locomotives operating, and performance improving. In the end, over 600 design faults, mainly in the Crossley engine, were overcome. Rumours persist suggesting the engine was either war surplus, or formerly from a sub maritime application.[3] Neither of these are correct, despite some publications suggesting this.[4] The myth may arise from Crossleys success in delivering robust engines for marine and other modes of transport.Interestingly, it has been noted that the Irish Railways (CIÉ), through the respected Engineer Oliver Bulleid, had "heard" through the British Admiralty that the "Crossley unit gave no trouble".[5] The Smith Royal Commission into the class identified blind faith in the British, and chided the WAGR for ignoring the advice of supervising engineers in the UK, who reported problems with the traction motor during testing.[6] Whilst Córas Iompair Éireann re-powered its Crossley powered locomotives to rid themselves of the problem,[5] The Smith Royal Commission recommended against this, and proposed the class be replaced.To be fair to the WAGR, it was not the only one that rushed into buying unproven traction. BR did so, buying many locomotives in its rush to dieselise that did little to improve its bottom line, including purchasing the disastrous Co-Bo Class 28 cousins [7] Multiple unit working[edit] X1007 in Bunbury During construction, 16 locomotives were fitted with multiple unit control and denoted the XA class.[8][9] These locomotives included communication doors at each end. The 16 XA's were numbered as a separate block to the X/Xb's, starting with class number 1401. From December 1963, Midland Workshops fitted 10 Xs for multiple unit working, these were reclassified as the Xb Class.[4][10] The Xb were not fitted with communication doors but did retain their original 10XX classification numbers. Other Modifications[edit] Whilst the class were built with locomotive air braking and train vacuum braking systems, during 1969 and 1970 8 of the XA's were modified to operate with dual vacuum/air braking systems manufactured by Davies Metcalf to allow them to operate air braked salt traffic on the Esperance Branch. This equipment was removed in the early 1980s, only to be reinstalled in XA1406 (October 1986) and XA1403 (November 1986) to allow these units to haul ex-QR coaches on suburban services. End of Career[edit] In their final years, those still in service were reputed to have performed well. They ran grain trains in the South West as late as 1984, and provided power for trains following the reopening of the Fremantle line up to the last retirement (XA1402) in 1988. The first were withdrawn in 1973, primarily as sources of spare parts. The last was withdrawn on 31 March 1988. Names[edit] The locomotives carried the names of tribes, tribal leaders and warriors from around Australia.

Transport in Vatican City
The transportation system in Vatican City, a country 1.05 km long and 0.85 km wide,[1] is a small transportation system with no airports or highways. There is no public transport in the country. A heliport and a short railway is used for special occasions only. Most visitors will walk from a nearby Italian bus or train stop, or car parking. Given an average walking speed of 3.6 km/h,[2] Vatican City can be crossed in 20 minutes or less. Thus, much of the infrastructure in the Vatican consists of St. Peter's Square itself, hallways and aisles in the basilica and surrounding buildings, and walkways behind and between the buildings.[1] The Vatican City Heliport is in the western corner of the city-state that is used for officials of the Holy See and official visitors.[3]

It does not have a public airport and visitors may use the two airports of Rome: Ciampino and Fiumicino. Railway[edit] Main article: Rail transport in Vatican City There is a short 852 meter 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1?2 in) (standard gauge) railway that connects to surrounding Italy's network at the Saint Peter's station in the capital of Rome. Vatican City railway station was designed by architect Giuseppe Momo and was constructed during the reign of Pope Pius XI after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaties and opened in 1933. The railway was originally planned to transport pilgrims, as was intended during the reign of Pius XI, but has only been rarely used to transport passengers. Pope John XXIII was the first to make use of the railway, and Pope John Paul II was known to have used it as well very rarely. The railway is mainly used only to transport freight. Rome Metro line A passes the country at Ottaviano and Cipro-Musei Vaticani metro stations. Both stops are a ten-minute walk away from the city-state.[4] Road vehicles[edit] Pope John Paul II in a Popemobile in the Vatican City State, with Vatican registration SCV 1 Vehicle registration plates of official road vehicles registered in Vatican City use the prefix SCV(standing for State of the City of Vatican) followed by a series of digits while vehicle registration plates of residential road vehicles registered in Vatican City use the prefix CV followed by a series of digits. The international identification plate/sticker is V. The Pope's car carries the registration SCV 1 in red lettering. As there is more than one vehicle used to transport the Pope, multiple registered vehicles in Vatican City use the SCV 1 registration plate. Vehicle fleet[edit] In September 2012, the Pope received two electric Kangoo Maxi ZE. One is planned to stay at the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo, and the second one is to be used by the Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City.[5] See also: Popemobile See also[edit] Index of Vatican City-related articles Popemobile References[edit] ^ a b Documentation ^ Walking speed ^ Vatican City Tiscali retrieved November 27, 2006 ^ Vatican City State Railway Railways of the World retrieved August 8, 2006 ^ Pope receives pair of electric cars from maker Renault External links[edit] Media related to License plates of the Vatican City at Wikimedia Commons v t e Holy See articles Including Vatican City, sovereign territory of the Holy See History History of the papacy Papal States Duchy of Rome Donation of Sutri Donation of Pepin "Prisoner in the Vatican" Lateran Palace Circus of Nero Old St. Peter's Basilica Savoyard era First Vatican Council Lateran Treaty Second Vatican Council Geography Apostolic Palace Castel Gandolfo Domus Sanctae Marthae (Pope Francis' residence) Gardens Mater Ecclesiae Monastery (Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI's residence) Paul VI Audience Hall Passetto di Borgo St. Peter's Basilica St. Peter's Square St. Peter's tomb Sistine Chapel ceiling Vatican Hill Vatican Museums Historical Museum Modern Religious Art Vatican Necropolis Politics Politics Pope List of sovereigns Elections Foreign relations Pontifical Commission Pontifical Council Government Roman Curia Secretariat of State Vicar General Law Fundamental Law of Vatican City State Crime Military Corpo della Gendarmeria Swiss Guard Economy Banking Communications .va [Internet domain] Secretariat for the Economy Tourism Transport rail Culture Academy of Sciences AT telescope observatory Anthem Catholic Church Coats of arms Demographics Flag Languages Media Secretariat for Communications newspaper radio television information service Music National football team Philatelic and Numismatic Office Public holidays Vatican Cricket Team Vatican Library film secret archives Pope portal Vatican City portal Catholicism portal v t e Transport in Europe Sovereign states Albania Andorra Armenia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Belgium Bosnia and Herzegovina Bulgaria Croatia Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Georgia Germany Greece Hungary Iceland Ireland Italy Kazakhstan Latvia Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macedonia Malta Moldova Monaco Montenegro Netherlands Norway Poland Portugal Romania Russia San Marino Serbia Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden Switzerland Turkey Ukraine United Kingdom Vatican City States with limited recognition Abkhazia Kosovo Nagorno-Karabakh Northern Cyprus South Ossetia Transnistria Dependencies and other territories Åland Faroe Islands Gibraltar Guernsey Isle of Man Jersey Svalbard Other entities European Union Coordinates: 41°54?3?N 12°27?4?E? / ?41.90083°N 12.45111°E? / 41.90083; 12.45111

Elin Pelin
Elin Pelin (Bulgarian: ???? ?????) (8 July 1877 – 3 December 1949), born Dimitar Ivanov Stoyanov (Bulgarian: ??????? ?????? ???????) is arguably considered Bulgaria’s best narrator of country life. Born into a large family in the village of Bailovo near Sofia, he loved writing and reading from an early age. Studying to become a teacher, he taught for a year in 1895 in his native village. He was first published in 1901, and the respect it earned him in literary circles encouraged him to go to Sofia in 1903, where he worked as a librarian at the university library. It was during this period he took his now-famous pseudonym from the word pelin, which means wormwood in Bulgarian. He spent 1906-07 in France, perfecting his skills in the language. By this time, he was already a popular writer.

(8 July 1877 – 3 December 1949), born Dimitar Ivanov Stoyanov (Bulgarian: ??????? ?????? ???????) is arguably considered Bulgaria’s best narrator of country life. Born into a large family in the village of Bailovo near Sofia, he loved writing and reading from an early age. Studying to become a teacher, he taught for a year in 1895 in his native village. He was first published in 1901, and the respect it earned him in literary circles encouraged him to go to Sofia in 1903, where he worked as a librarian at the university library. It was during this period he took his now-famous pseudonym from the word pelin, which means wormwood in Bulgarian. He spent 1906-07 in France, perfecting his skills in the language. By this time, he was already a popular writer. Between 1910 and 1916, he was the director of special collections at the National Library and also served as editor of numerous magazines, including the children’s publication Veselushka. Additionally, he served as a war correspondent during World War I. In 1911, one of his most famous works appeared, The Gerak Family (Bulgarian: Geratsite). It is one of the best-known pieces of Bulgarian literature and deals with a traditional village family experiencing the transition from the simplicity of rurality to the modernization of Bulgarian society, a world in which old time practices founded on family love and dedication to the land start to disappear. His second great work, Earth (Bulgarian: Zemya), was published in 1922. In this book, Pelin created a gallery of characters who identified with the national character and conscience. Pelin’s works—poems, short stories and novels—recreated the peasant and countryside atmosphere of the old Bulgaria. His predilection for short stories led him to write many, of which the humouristic Pizho and Penda is perhaps the best known. A genuine realism, with descriptions full of light and color, classify his works. Considered one of the masters of Bulgarian prose, he was also one of the initiators of Bulgarian children’s literature. His tales of Yan Bibiyan and his voyages to the moon still delight today. From 1924 until 1944, Pelin served as conservator at the Ivan Vazov Museum, all the while continuing to write, mostly for children, and be published. In 1940, he was named president of the Union of Bulgarian Writers. After the War, he managed to escape being blacklisted as a forbidden author by the Communist government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The regime chose to consider his works as those of a realistic, critical author, ? precursor of Socialist Realism who, although not having correctly seized the true nature of the Bourgeois state, knew how to tell about the working life and individual revolt of exploited peasants. Earth and The Gerak Family, amongst other works, have been filmed several times (1930 and 1957, and 1958, respectively). Statue of Yan Bibyan and Imp Fyut in Sofia, author Nikolai Zikov Honour[edit] The town of Elin Pelin was named after him. Elin Pelin Point on Smith Island, South Shetland Islands is named after him too. There is yet another place in America called the Elin Pelin place, where you can view a beautiful monument of Elin Pelin.

Luis Bernardo Honwana
Luís Bernado Honwana (born 1942) is a Mozambican author.
Luís Bernado Honwana (born 1942) is a Mozambican author. Biography[edit] Luís Bernardo Honwana was born Luís Augusto Bernardo Manuel in Lourenço Marques (present-day Maputo), Mozambique. His parents, Raúl Bernardo Manuel (Honwana) and Naly Jeremias Nhaca, belonged to the Ronga people from Moamba, a town about 55 km northwest of Maputo. In 1964 he became a militant with FRELIMO, a front that had the objective to liberate Mozambique from Portuguese colonial rule. Due to his political activities he was arrested by the colonial authorities and was incarcerated for three years. He studied law in Portugal and worked for some time as a journalist. He was appointed director of President's office under Samora Machel. Later in 1981, he became Secretary of State for culture. He served on the Executive Board of UNESCO from 1987 to 1991 and was chairman of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Committee for the World Decade for Culture and Development. In 1995, he was appointed director of the newly opened UNESCO office in South Africa. Since he retired from the organization in 2002, he has been active in research in the arts, history and ethno-linguistics. [1] Works[edit] Honwana is the author of a single book, Nós Matámos o Cão-Tinhoso (1964), translated into English as We Killed Mangy Dog and Other Stories, and the tale "Hands of the Blacks". This work has proved enormously influential and a case can be made for it being the touchstone of contemporary Mozambican narrative. We Killed Mangy Dog is a collection of short stories set in the (Portuguese) colonial era at the turn of the sixties and is reflective of the harsh life black Mozambicans lived under the Salazar regime. Several of the stories are told from the point of view of children or alienated adolescents and most feature the rich mix of races, religions and ethnicities that would later preoccupy Mozambique's most internationally celebrated writer, Mia Couto.

After 5 years, Daniel Berozlzheimer’s son Henry purchased the city’s first iron framed building for the new factory. The company produced pens, pencils, pen holders and erasers. In 1897, the London branch confirmed the policy of selling manufactured goods with high quality. Over the years, the company changed focus and goods. In 1952, Margros Ltd was founded by Mr P.G.Hooley, who invented Powdered Colour and sold it directly to schools. Business grew such that the owners were unable to finance operations adequately, and the company was sold to Eagle Pencil Company in 1967.[1] The company which later became Osmiroid International was started in 1824 by James Perry who joined his brother in the pen?making business.[1] In 1989, the company was bought by Berol Ltd. The Newell Company joined forces with Berol on November 2, 1995. The merging of the two companies made Berol a branch of the Sanford Corporation.[1] Colored pencils[edit] One of Prismacolor's main products are their colored pencils. They can be bought in sets from 12 to 150 pencils, and are typically cheaper when purchased in bulk. Prices vary but they are usually around $1.50 to $2.00 per pencil. They have a color-matching 8mm hexagonal barrel and are typically packaged in a plastic or tin case. The wax core is 5mm in diameter. [2] Prismacolor colored pencils are made with a soft wax that tends to break easily. Softer lead tends to break easier when a pencil is sharpened. With Prismacolored colored pencils a common trend is to microwave them.[3] Microwaving a colored pencil helps to heat up the cold and brittle lead within it. Prismacolor currently offers a range of 150 colors and a variety of blending products to blend colors together in an artwork. The blender pencil is a clear, colorless wax pencil used overtop of the colored layer to aid in the color cohesion.[4] Markers[edit] The line of markers Prismacolor produce are illustrating markers. Each marker is double-sided for fine to thick lines. The formula inside the marker gives the pigment a rich color and allow for smooth application onto paper. The common method of a Prismacolor marker is to apply the colors in layers. The different tips allow for the color to be applied in various ways on the application being worked on. Artists use varying colors from the same color line to create shadows and textures on the artwork. Prismacolor markers can also be used to sketch drawings as well as color.[5] Charcoal[edit] Prismacolor Charcoal is used for sketching in general or under paintings. The sticks come in many forms including vine, compressed, and wooden sticks. Pastel[edit] Prismacolor pastels are available in several different styles. Hard, soft, oil, and pencil pastels which each offer different textures and styles to a piece of art. Pastels are made into sticks for easy handling. The sticks are pure pigment with very few fillers to help support the structure and lay of color. There are two qualities to pastels: Artist and Student. Artist quality pastels have a higher ratio of pigment giving more intense color. Student pastels contain more fillers and byproduct to help the stick keep shape and allow the pastel to withstand pressure and crumbling. With artist pastels, the richer pigments and lack of binder cause the product to be more fragile yet costly. Hard pastels are made the same way as a soft pastel but contain more binder and less pigment. Hard pastels are more stable in different drawing techniques and come in both artist and student quality. Pastel pencils are for fine details and control. The shape and size of a pastel pencils resemble colored pencils and are suitable for outdoors work. The make up of oil pastels is pigment coated in wax or oil giving lines and shading a crayon like texture. Oil pastels are more stable than a soft pastel and do not require a fixative to work. Unlike the other types of pastels, oil based pastels will not smudge, crumble or give off dust when working on paper. Although oil pastels lack the ability to blend into other colors, the pigments can be spread on a canvas like oil paints and are available in both student and artist quality.[6] Products[edit] Prismacolor's range of products include:[7] Line Range of Products Colored pencils Colored pencils, watercolor pencils Graphite Graphite pencils, mechanical pencils Pastels Softpastels, Nupastels Charcoal Charcoal sticks and pencils Markers Markers, highlighters Accessories Sharpeners, erasers, fixatives, pencil refills, A Prismacolor colored pencil sketch of painter Ross Bleckner Berol Prismacolor pencils References[edit] ^ a b c "Berol History". www.berol.co.uk.

The small town of the same name is the administrative seat of this municipality in the region (Comarca) of Llevant.

This equates to 50.9 inhabitants per km2. In 2006 the percentage of foreigners was 13.2% (890), of which Germans made up 3.9% (262). In 1991 there were still 136 illiterates in the municipality. 1,292 inhabitants had no education, 1,675 only a primary school certificate and 1,210 had secondary school leaving certificates. The official languages are Catalan and Spanish (Castilian). The Catalan dialect spoken on the island is known as Mallorquí. Geography[edit] The town of Artà Location[edit] Artà lies in the northeast of the island of Majorca, around 60 km from the island's capital of Palma. The Massís d’Artà, the highest and most compact massif in the eastern mountain chain of the Serres de Llevant, occupies more than half the area of the municipality. The municipality is located on the western part of peninsula of Artà and is bordered in the west by the Bay of Alcúdia (Badia d’Alcúdia), and in the north by the Mediterranean sea where its coast lies opposite the neighbouring island of Minorca. The coast of Artà stretches for 25 kilometres and, so far, has escaped being developed.[1] Particularly noteworthy are the beach and sand dune formations of sa Canova d’Artà, the flat coastal strip near the settlement of Colònia de Sant Pere, the high rocky coves of the Cap de Ferrutx and a large number of smaller bays that extend from s’Arenalet des Verger to Cala Torta. Neighbouring communities[edit] To the east and southeast the municipality of Artà is bordered by the communities of Capdepera and Son Servera. Until the 19th century both belonged, together with the district of Artà, to the so-called Peninsula of Artà. Hence why the caves on the east coast of Majorca in the municipality of Capdepera are called the Caves of Artà (Coves d' Artà). To the southwest are the municipalities of Sant Llorenç des Cardassar and Petra. The Torrent de na Borges, with its hamlet of Son Serra de Marina, forms the western border of Artà with the municipality of Santa Margalida. Subdivisions[edit] The following villages are part of the municipality of Artà: Artà (5803 / 6406) Colònia de Sant Pere (483 / 483) Urbanització Betlem (51 / 51) Urbanització Montferrutx (114 / 114) Urbanització Sant Pere (34 / 34) Urbanització s’Estanyol (25 / 25) The figures in brackets give the population as at 1 January 2008. The first figure is the number of inhabitants in the main settlement, the second includes those living in 'scattered' dwellings outside the village itself. (Source: INE) Natural regions[edit] Hills above Urbanització Betlem Eight moderate to high hills belong to the municipality of Artà, the Puig Morei (also Puig d’en Morell or Talaia Freda) at 561 metres being the highest and the Puig d'en Mir being the lowest at 256 metres. The municipality is characterized by extensive areas of uninhabited terrain, especially in the regions in the mountains of the Serres de Llevant. Today, this natural region has become very barren as a result of numerous forest fires in recent years. Fan palms in the region of Artà The area of the Caps de Ferrutx, with its rocky coves provides the osprey and peregrine falcon, for example, an ideal refuge. The northern coastal region is also home to feral goats. In the valleys of the Massis d’Artà, also called the Serra Artana, there are small groves of holly oak, enclosed by dry stone walls, where almond, fig and carob trees are cultivated. Orchards of olive trees predominate in the hills, growing on steep slopes retained by dry stone walls. Large beds of reed are found amongst the natural vegetation along with fan palms (Chamaerops humilis) typical of the region, low clumps of luxuriant shrubs, wild olive trees and isolated pine woods. The fan palm is still a primary raw material for the basket makers on Majorca. Climate[edit] Rainfall is recorded in Artà all year round. The driest month is July with an average of 8.8 l/m2. October records the highest rainfall with an average of 101.3 l/m2. 1945 was the wettest year with 224.3 l/m2. History[edit] Talaiot of Sa Canova Artà was first mentioned in 1232 under the name Yartân in the Llibre de repartiment de mallorca (Jaume I). Later it was also written down as Jartan or Jertan. The origin of the name is derived from "Gertan", the Arab word for garden. This extraordinary landscape has been inhabited since the colonization of Majorca, as witnessed by the archaeological finds in this area:Ses Païsses and Sa Canova. They date from the time 1300–100 BC. The coins, seals and vessels of the Talaiotic culture may be seen in the Artà Regional Museum at Plaça d'Espanya. Little is known about the Artà region from the Roman or pre-Islamic period. It is believed, however, that the old fortress on the town's hill dates to before the Islamic-Arab possession of the island. In the Arabian era from the 10th to the 13th century and even during the early days of Catalan rule, the fortress was known as the Almudaina, which means something like "castle" or "fortress". Parish church and pilgrimage church Today the one-meter thick fortress wall with its nine towers, including the main tower of Sant Miquel, surrounds the pilgrimage church of Santuari de Sant Salvador with its outbuildings. The church houses a multicoloured, carved, wooden, Romanesque statue of the Virgin Mary, which, according to the tradition of the White canons was brought to the island by James I during the conquest of Majorca. A Calvary staircase of 180 steps links the parish church (Esglèsia Parroquial) of Transfiguració del Senyor at the foot of the town's hill with the 1832 baroque church of Sant Salvador on the 182-metre high Calvary Hill or Puig de Sant Salvador. The 1573 late Gothic style church of La Transfiguració replaced the ancient parish church consecrated in 1248 on the site of an earlier mosque. The town of Artà The old station building During the Arab or Moorish era the peninsula of Yartan was one of thirteen districts of Majorca. After the Catalan conquest of the island the present town of Artà emerged in the 13th century after the arrival of the Norbertines, or White Monks, who founded the Priory of Santa Maria del Bellpuig. The estate of Bellpuig is three miles southwest of Artà. From there, the present town area, the farms of Almudaina, were divided into lots and reallocated. The town was still called Almudaina in the 15th century, whilst the name Artà referred to the entire district. From the 16th to the 18th century the population of the city rose sharply and, in addition to agriculture, it developed a textile industry. An outbreak of bubonic plague in 1820 caused a setback resulting in 1200 deaths. In the 19th century the districts of Capdepera and Son Servera were separated from Artà. The greater part of the territory of Artà at that time was in the hands of big landowners. Among the small farmers the craft of basket making from palm leaves developed as an invaluable source of secondary income. In 1880, the land at Devesa de Ferrutx on the Bay of Alcúdia was divided up and the coastal village of Colonia de Sant Pere was founded as an agricultural settlement. This quiet tourist resort has the second highest population in the municipality after the town of Arta. The few villages in the municipality of Artà became well linked by roads in the 20th century, not least with a view to developing tourism, which is now the most important industry on the island. Nevertheless, large parts of the area are still virtually unspoilt due to its sparse settlement, which led to the designation of the nature reserve Parc Natural de la Península de Llevant in the north of the borough of Artà. The railway line from Palma via Manacor and Son Servera to Artà was opened in 1921 but no longer operates. However, there is a plan to re-open a service from Manacor, which should start during the next legislative session.[when?] Historical population of Artà (Source: INE) Year 1842 1877 1887 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1981 1991 2001 2008 Population 4001 5123 5837 5816 5769 6040 5841 6117 5511 5410 5462 5630 5716 6176 7113 Culture and places of interest[edit] Fountain square in Artà Most striking is the enclosed nature of the settlement, with its steep narrow roads that begin at the foot of the hill, and are dominated by the medieval fortress walls of the pilgrimage church of Sant Salvador at the top of the town. The terrace offers a panoramic view of the coast and the hills, the almond orchards, olive groves and the Torre de Canyamel, as well as the fortified Gothic parish church (Transfiguració del Senyor) immediately below the hill. From the side of the valley it looks particularly impressive with its high supporting towers. Inside, the wooden Majorcan pulpit and the altar with the Transfiguration of Christ are especially worth seeing. Town Hall and Regional Museum The Regional Museum of Artà at the Plaça d'Espanya was founded in 1927 by a group of scholars from the town. Artefacts in the museum come from private collections. It is divided into an ethnological, natural history and archaeological departments. The ethnological division displays the various tools used by the palm weavers working in the Llevant today. Also on display are tools of the Majorcan textile trades. The archaeological collection contains a variety of artefacts made of ceramic, bronze, iron and bone, mainly from Majorca's prehistory. Artà has much to offer the visitor. Of particular interest is the coastal area of the municipality. Right on its border with Santa Margalida, in the hamlet of Son Serra de Marina, is the beach of s'Arenal de sa Canova with its extensive dunes. A coastal path runs along the beach up to the village of s'Estanyol near Colonia de Sant Pere. Further east, between s'Estanyol and es Caló are steep cliffs and ravines alternate with small sandy beaches. The north of the municipality is dominated by the Massís d’Artà, with the hills Puig Morei (561m), Puig de sa Tudossa (444m) and Talaia Moreia (432m). The hills fall steeply towards the north, but more gently north-eastward toward the coast. In the northeast of the area several sandy bays have formed at the mouths of so-called torrents. On the coastal hills can still be found towers built between the 16th and 18th century. Nestling amidst the hills, is the Ermita de Betlem, a hermitage inhabited by a monks. Parts of the north coast are covered with pine forests. Churches and abbeys[edit] Santuari de Sant Salvador Pilgrimage church of Sant Salvador, surrounded by its dominating wall fortifications Parish church of Transfiguració del Senyor (Late Gothic with wooden Majorcan pulpit) Franciscan abbey of Sant Antoni de Pàdua (Baroque church with barrel vault) Priory of Santa Maria del Bellpuig (Abbey of the Norbertine canons) Ermita de Betlem hermitage (9 kilometres northwest of the town, in the hills) Museums and exhibitions[edit] The regional museum, Museu Regional d’Artà, Carrer Estrella 4, on the Plaça d’Espanya next to the town hall Town hall of Na Batlessa in the Carrer de Ciutat (community hall with exhibition rooms and library) Teatre d’Artà, theatre for around 460 people (since 2001) Museum Hause of Can cardaix Structures[edit] Steps to the Calvary, flanked by cypresses and stone crosses Islamic fort of Almudaina d’Artà Town square of Plaça del Conqueridor Talaiotic village of Ses Païsses, a prehistoric Talaiotic settlement Talaiotic settlement on the estate of sa Canova de Morell near Colònia de Sant Pere Caves[edit] Dripstone cave of Coves d’Artà (municipality of Capdepera, east coast) Beaches and bays[edit] Beaches and bays of Artà S’Arenal de Sa Canova S’Estanyol S’Arenalet des Verger Sa Font Celada Cala Matzoc Cala Estreta Cala Mitjana Cala Torta Markets[edit] Market day in Artà Street market every Tuesday (except public holidays) on the Plaça del Conqueridor Handicrafts market every Tuesday morning in the grounds of the Villa Na Batlessa Artà trade fair on the second Sunday in September in the town Festivals[edit] Saint Anthony (16 and 17 January) Saint Antoni de Pàdua (also: Aprikot Festival, 13 June) Festival of Sant Salvador (5, 6 and 7 August) Economy and infrastructure[edit] Handicraft[edit] Productos Artesanos Palmeros In the region around Artà the craft of basketry (Obra de llatra) has been preserved, along with pottery, as one of the oldest crafts on the island of Majorca. The remains of braided and woven plant fibres have been found in archaeological digs here. The main raw material in the western Mediterranean area is the native fan palm with its robust but flexible leaves. This one-metre-high species of palm occurs naturally on Majorca, especially between Manacor and Artà, and today is grown in large fields around the town of Artà. The leaves of the fan palm are collected in the months of June and July and first dried in the sun. When they have become a yellowish-white colour, they are separated into finer strands and sorted qualitatively. Next, the higher-quality palm strands are soaked in a mixture of water and chlorine, then sulphurised, which bleaches them further and makes them flexible enough to work. The now soft leaves, called palmito, are then woven into the basic shape of the basket using fixed stems or leaves at right angles to one another. By re-drying the leaves, they contract slightly, giving the mesh extra stability and density. Using coloured leaves or special techniques elaborate patterns are created, sometimes woven into the basic mesh or sometimes into a second or even third layer. The best-known products of the basket weaving industry include baskets, hats, backpacks, bags, etc. From the waste material, stalks and leaf parts are broken down into fibres to make brooms and rope. The baskets are sold in many of the markets on the island.

Contents 1 History 1.1 Sky Multichannels 1.2 Virgin Media 1.3 Possible relaunch 2 Programming 3 References 4 External links History[edit] Bravo was launched on December 31, 1985, as a cable only channel, created by United Artists Programming[1] broadcasting mainly black & white B-movies from the 1950s and 1960s. Initially, the channel was a cassette-delivered service provided to cable headends for automatic play-out. In 1991, United Artists merged with their largest shareholder TCI (now[update] Liberty Media), to form the largest cable operator in the United States. TCI and US West announced a joint venture and, in 1992, the joint venture company became Telewest Communications. In 1993, talks were held with Tele-Communications Inc. which resulted in Flextech acquiring TCI's European programming business in exchange for shares.[2] By January, the deal was complete with TCI,[3] allowing it to acquire 60.4% of Flextech while Flextech acquired 100% of Bravo, 25% of UK Gold, 31% of UK Living, and 25% of the Children's Channel which increased its share in that channel.[4] Sky Multichannels[edit] On July 22, 1993,[5] Bravo launched on the Astra 1C satellite in anticipation of the launch of Sky Multichannels in September 1993. With the launch on Astra, the channel started broadcasting between noon and midnight (as opposed to 3pm to 3am), until 3 February 1997, when Trouble launched and took over the channel's afternoon and early evening broadcast hours, meaning Bravo would broadcast between 20:00 and 06:00. European Business News time shared with the channel on weekdays and Living on weekends until 2001.[6][better source needed] Its programming output was altered around the same time, when the channel obtained many of the ITC Entertainment productions which included shows like the cult series The Avengers. It upgraded its on-screen image with an elaborate station identifier of a modernist skyscraper under rolling thunderclouds and promoted itself as 'Timewarp Television'. It used stars like Roger Moore and Tony Curtis to feature in specialty shot trails. Armstrong and Miller first made their broadcast television appearance on Bravo in a series of presentation promotions during its Cult Weekend on 5 August 1995. In 1996, a policy change to withdraw the black & white shows contributed to the channel moving on to specialize in science fiction and horror with movies from the Troma Entertainment catalog. It then became known for showing crime documentaries by day and adult programming at night. It subsequently decreased the adult content and increased sports and imported shows like Alias. It also aired World Championship Wrestling's flagship show Nitro during WCW's final year in business and also showed Extreme Championship Wrestling's show ECW Hardcore TV during its final year in business. Virgin Media[edit] Bravo's on-screen card after it ceased broadcasting. On 28 August 2005, the channel started showing Serie A Italian football, bringing back the Channel 4 format Football Italia. However, poor viewing figures resulted first in the cancellation of the weekly Gazetta Football Italia show, then the announcement that Bravo would stop showing Italian Football altogether after 23 December 2006. The channel's other highest-profile sports coverage was Ultimate Fighting Championship archives, for which it held exclusive UK rights, as well as recent events (live rights are now held by BT Sport), as well as the related reality TV show The Ultimate Fighter. From January 2007, Bravo's sister channel Bravo 2 had the exclusive UK rights to broadcast Total Nonstop Action Wrestling programming, a two-day delay from the American broadcast of TNA's weekly show TNA iMPACT! and a three-day delay for TNA's monthly Pay Per Views. (On 3 February 2011, this programming moved to Challenge, and is now known as Impact Wrestling.) On 5 January 2008, TNA iMPACT was moved to Bravo with replays of the show on Bravo 2. Bravo's original contract for TNA Wrestling programming was for eighteen months and was distributed by RDA TV; the deal, which was once again negotiated by RDA TV, was extended on 1 July 2008 for an additional eighteen months.[7][8][9] From 3 June 2008 onward, Bravo, along with the other Living TV Group owned channels began broadcasting in widescreen (16:9). This was coupled with a redesign of the on-screen graphic; the word BRAVO was shown rather than the logo. On 25 May 2010, Virgin Media Television unveiled new channel branding for Bravo to coincide with a major new series Spartacus: Blood and Sand. It involved a new logo to "match the premium content and ambition of the channel" along with a new strapline, "Bravo: Home of the Brave".[10] On 15 September 2010, BSkyB announced that it would close Bravo as well as its sister channel Bravo 2.[11] For November 2010, Bravo rebranded as Brav-Mo to celebrate Movember. From December 24-31, 2010, Bravo celebrated its final week with a marathon of its most popular shows called "Bravo, We Salute You". On 1 January 2011 at 4:00am, Bravo ceased broadcasting on all platforms. The last program aired was World's Most Amazing Videos.[12] Possible relaunch[edit] In August 2013, it was revealed that BSkyB had registered the trademark for 'Sky Bravo', paving the way for a possible relaunch of the channel,[13] although nothing has been heard about it since.

Contents 1 Plot summary 2 Cast 3 Soundtrack 4 External links Plot summary[edit] The film brims with British comedy talent of the period. The Crazy Gang’s mobile fish and chip shop is accidentally tied to a barrage balloon and the gang is carried to Nazi Germany. They are captured but break out of prison, impersonate Adolf Hitler and return to England in a stolen secret weapon. The film was a morale-booster at a period of the war when Britain looked in real danger of defeat.

Double-square painting
Double-square paintings have uncommonly large canvases. Vincent van Gogh, for example, used them almost exclusively during the final weeks of his life in Auvers, in June and July 1890.[1] To arrive at this size, Van Gogh simply had to combine the legs of two standard sizes: the 50 cm leg from a size 12 and the 100 cm leg of a size 40 stretcher. The result was a double-square of 50 x 100 cm, and from this size easily the square could be derived by using two 50 cm legs.

Other artists prior to Van Gogh such as Charles-François Daubigny and Puvis de Chavannes[2] had used canvases of similar proportions, and Van Gogh was aware of this. But his choice of this size points into another direction. His double-squares can easily be combined with size 30 canvases to more elaborated décorations, and his squares extend these possibilities. One dimension of a double-square canvas is twice the size of the other. In other words, the canvas is the shape of two adjoining squares. The overall effect of this is stability, and the compositional challenge is to avoid monotony.

Morita Kanya XII
Morita Kanya XII (?????????) (9 November 1846 – 21 August 1897) was the leading Japanese theatre manager of the first half of the Meiji period, between 1868 and 1912. He built the first modern theater, the Shintomi-za (???), which incorporated Western features such as gaslights and chairs. The theater opened in June 1878, and was located at a foreign settlement in Tsukiji, Tokyo. He was also a crucial factor in attracting the new audience, the aristocracy, into the kabuki theaters (Kikan).

Although the shogunal police stopped him that time, his spirit and interest for the West remained an integral part of his personality. During the time of government takeover (1868), the 22-year-old Morita Kanya XII became so obsessed with the Western world that he would eat sashimi (a traditional Japanese dish) with salt and pepper as opposed to soy sauce and wasabi (Yuichiro). Personal life[edit] Kanya was friends with the father of the playwright Okamoto Kido. According to Kido he was extremely polite, almost obsequious, and in his very Westernised way on one occasion brought a gift of a box of Western sweets to Kido's home which had been bought from a sweet shop F?getsudo (???). When residents of the British Legation headed up by Thomas McClatchie presented Kanya with a theatre curtain times were uncertain with an undercurrent of anti Western sentiment amongst some feudal domains. There was an exchange of letters between Kanya, McClatchie and an Austro-Hungarian diplomat, Heinrich Von Siebold about the curtain and an invitation from Kanya to a special inaugural event . I am writing this letter to say that, as a consequence of the rebuild, I would like to extend an honourable invitation to you two young foreign residents in T?ky? to the occasion of the opening of the Shintomiza on 7th June 1879 and to offer you, along with my fellow countrymen, our hospitality at an august speech welcoming you and an expression of appreciation. Furthermore, as regards to the matter in question, I will measure the time until your kind response to this request. Once it has been presented I will, on receiving the gift of this superb curtain, be hanging it to serve in a place of honour. I trust that this will be to our mutual satisfaction. On a separate note this curtain, the appearance of which more than meets expectations, will encourage those whose names will appear on the certificate of the impending gift to agree. On this the appeal of this proposal will be supported. Yours sincerely, 3rd February 1879, in T?ky? to ASAP Hospitality Company, Heinrich Von Siebold, and Thomas McClatchie from the head of the T?ky? Shintomiza, Morita Kan’ya the younger To which McClatchie replied... I am coming to Japan to attend the upcoming occasion. I respectfully advise caution as it may be dangerous to be associated with me my friends. In Japan people like the so called r?nin with their katana swords have long been in armed factions. Foreigners seen by them are immediately killed. I am pleased to be able to travel in Japan about which my mother has stopped crying. Coming to watch it’s not my intention to be beheaded by r?nin. The theatre is very pretty and we will be watching a beautiful play. It’s so pleasant don’t you agree? I respectfully ask that I be provided with the details to be written and sent to me care of my friend the mother of Great Britain (Queen Victoria) Kanya replied... I read your gracious letter in response to all the invitations sent for which I would like to thank you for confirming that you will be a guest in on the said occasion in June. Such a magnificent set of stage curtains that you have so kindly and honourably given I received with humble thanks. As for the matter in question, the occasion of this inauguration, it will be my honour to organise to the best of my ability, the better the honour for future generations. After this the illustrations will be seen in ?saka where all the separate designs will be displayed. With all due respect to you my three noble friends then you will be received with appropriate speeches of thanks and honour. I will measure the time preciously until your response for this article with the family crest which will in the named theatre be honoured. Respectfully, yours sincerely.4th February, Morita Kan’ya (Skingle) The Kabuki reforms[edit] The Kabuki theater was greatly affected during the reforms of the Meiji period. The main concern of the government was to transform the art of Kabuki into something similar to that of the western form. This placed theater from a common into a high social role, in which aristocrats and nobles would come and view the performances. Kabuki was to represent a civilized Japan (mostly for the sake of impressing westerners). In 1872, Kabuki leaders, including Morita Kanya XII were asked to participate in a discussion at the Tokyo city hall. There, the changes were addressed and Morita Kanya XII saw this as an opportunity to become a wealthy businessman with the hope to become the director of the future National Theatre of Japan. When he built his Shintomi-za he implemented the desired reforms, which later were referred to as "engeki kairyo." (Tschudin) Career[edit] Morita Kanya was the owner of one of the three theatres licensed under the Tokugawa shogun regime: the Morita-za. Following the government takeover in 1868, Morita Kanya built the Morita-za in 1872, which marked a transformation of the Japanese Kabuki theater structure. In 1875, he had financial difficulties and reorganized the Morita-za into a company, which changed the theater’s name to Shintomi-za. A year later in 1876, the theater burned down, but Morita Kanya immediately rebuilt after its destruction. In 1878 it was completed and named Shintomi-za. (Yuichiro) The grand reopening ceremony took place on 7 June 1878 attended by the then Chief Minister Prince Sanj? Sanetomi (?? ??). (Skingle) The Shintomi-za was furnished with Western chairs designed for Western visitors and gas lighting for the stage. A member of the British Legation in T?ky?, Thomas Russell Hillier McClatchie, attended the opening ceremony and by all accounts he thoroughly enjoyed watching the opening night performances and later wrote to his mother and friends about it. Okamoto Keinosuke (later Kiyoshi - father of playwright Okamoto Kido - ?? ??)and friend of Morita Kanya, employed at the time as an interpreter at the British Legation, helped McClatchie to design a gift from the foreign residents for Shintomiza and on 3 February 1879, the theatre was presented with a curtain made from purple satin with intricate pine, bamboo and plum designs and Morita Kanya’s katabami emblem. Morita was overjoyed and hung the curtain for the March performances which began on 28 February. (Skingle) The climax of Morita Kanya XII’s career was in June 1879 when foreign aristocrat Crown Prince Heinrich of Germany and on 16 July 1879 U.S. President Ulysses Grant came to the Shintomi-za and was treated to a performance of Yoshi-iye. (Brandon) All of these changes transformed Shintomi-za into Japan’s "national theatre", although it was not referred to as such.[1] Morita Kanya XII’s changes in the world of Kabuki theater[edit] Elimination of thrust stage[edit] During the heyday of Kabuki in the Edo period (1603–1868), the relationship between actor and audience was supposed to be strong and intimate. This meant that it was common for actors to interact with its audience. For instance, in the midst of the performance, the actors would come onto the "thrust stage" (a stage that extends into the audience) and interact with them. Morita Kanya XII with his attempt to transform kKabuki into a more respectable art form eliminated the thrust stage, thereby adhering to a western convention. This ended the relationship between actor and audience. (Samuel L. Leiter, ed., A Kabuki Reader (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2002)) Reform of Kabuki plays[edit] In 1878, Morita Kanya XII, following the government’s demand for historical accuracy, produced the play “Okige no Kumo Harau Asagochi” which was based on a real recent uprising. He also integrated elements of "good" morale into the dialogues of his actors, with the goal to civilize the commoners (Yuichiro). He also westernized some plays to appeal to western visitors. For instance, he wrote two Kabuki plays set in Europe in 1879. At another instance he would hire a play writer to create a play based on the General Grant’s victories in the American Civil War. (Brandon) Changes in architecture and furniture[edit] The use of Western chairs for the audience, now standard in all Japanese theatres, was introduced in Kanya's Shintomi-za. The size of the stage, which remained the same for over a century, was also enlarged when Morita Kanya XII built the Shintomi-za. (Yuichiro) Later life[edit] In 1894, Morita Kanya XII was forced to give up his theater management duty.[2] He had a major financial crisis in which he lost 20,000 yen in the production of the play Hyoryu Kidan Seiyo-geki, which turned out to be very unsuccessful due to the poor acting of Western performers (Yuichiro). In 1909, the Shintonomi-za was bought by Shochiku.[2] The last time Okamoto Kido and his father saw him was at the Bairin Tea House at the Kabukiza in Meiji 29 (1896) when they attended Ichikawa Danj?r? IX's revival performance of 'Shibaraku' (Wait a Minute), and 'Sukeroku'. At the time, according to Okamoto Kido's father, he had debts of ¥700,000 - ¥800,000 in 2011 values about ¥2,250,000,000 - ¥2,570,000,000, equal to about £14.5 – £15 Million or $22.25 – $22.5 million. He died on 21 August Meiji 30 (1897) at his home on Akasaka District's Nakano-ch? (Skingle) Notes[edit] ^ "Masterpieces of Kabuki" (PDF). James R. Brandon and Samuel L. Leiter.

Graells's tamarin
Graells's tamarin, Saguinus graellsi, is a species of tamarin from the northwestern Amazon in southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and northeastern Peru. It has often been treated as a subspecies of the black-mantled tamarin, but differs from that species in having a dull olive-brown (no reddish-orange) lower back, rump and thighs.[3] The two are often said to be sympatric in Colombia (a major argument for treating them as separate species), though the accuracy of such reports has been questioned.[4]

Chasca (Salvadoran folklore)
Chasca, also known as "la virgen del agua" (The virgin of the water), is the name of a fictional character in Salvadoran folklore.
Chasca, also known as "la virgen del agua" (The virgin of the water), is the name of a fictional character in Salvadoran folklore. According to oral tradition, in the barra de Santiago lived a man named Pachacutec, who arranged a marriage between his daughter, Chasca, and a prince of the zutuhil tribe.[1] Chasca, however, was already in love with a young fisher named Acayatl. She would sneak away from her father to the beach where Acayatl would serenade her. One horrible day, someone shot an arrow at Acayatl while he returned from fishing. The assassin was sent by Pachacutec. Chasca saw the murder and screamed with horror, and decided to join her lover in death. She tied a rock around her waist and threw herself into the water. The following night of a full moon, the spirit of Chasca appeared for the first time in a white canoe next to Acayatl, from this time, she has continued to appear in this way. Whenever the fishermen notice a full moon, they do not go out to fish because they wish to respect and not disturb the virgin of the water and her lover, who in return for that respect, bless the fishermen with bountiful fish.

Postdevelopment theory
Postdevelopment theory (also post-development, or anti-development) holds that the whole concept and practice of development is a reflection of Western-Northern hegemony over the rest of the world. Postdevelopment thought arose in the 1980s out of criticisms voiced against development projects and development theory, which justified them.

Postdevelopment thought arose in the 1980s out of criticisms voiced against development projects and development theory, which justified them.

The academic, political, and economic nature of development means it tends to be policy oriented, problem-driven, and therefore effective only in terms of and in relation to a particular, pre-existing social theory. The actual development projects thus initiated, by both governments and NGOs, are directed in accordance with this development theory. Development theory itself, however, assumes a framework already set in place by government and political culture in order to implement it. The development process is therefore socially constructed; Western interests are guiding its direction and outcome, and so development itself fundamentally reflects the pattern of Western hegemony. Development as an ideology and a social vision is ingrained in the ideals of modernization, which holds western economic structure and society as a universal model for others to follow and emulate. Rooted in western influence, the developmental discourse reflects the unequal power relations between the west and the rest of the world, whereby the western knowledge of development, approach toward development, and conception of what development entails, as well as perceptions of progress, directs the course for the rest of the world. Reviewing development[edit] Influenced by Ivan Illich and other critics of colonialism and postcolonialism, a number of post-development theorists like Arturo Escobar and Gustavo Esteva have challenged the very meaning of development. According to them, the way we understand development is rooted in the earlier colonial discourse that depicts the North as "advanced" and "progressive", and the South as "backward", "degenerate" and "primitive". They point out that a new way of thinking about development began in 1949 with President Harry Truman's declaration: "The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealings." While claiming that the "era of development" began at this point, post development theorists do not suggest that the concept of development was new. What was new was the definition of development in terms of an escape from underdevelopment. Since the latter referred to two-thirds of the world, this meant that most societies were made to see themselves as having fallen into the undignified condition of "underdevelopment", and thus to look outside of their own cultures for salvation. Development, according to these critics, was now a euphemism for post-war American hegemony; it was the ideals and development programs of the United States and its (Western) European allies that would form the basis of development everywhere else. Post-development theory[edit] Post-development theory arose in the 1980s and 1990s through the works of scholars like A. Escobar, G. Esteva, M. Rahnema, W. Sachs, J. Ferguson, S. Latouche, G. Rist and F. Sabelli. Leading members of the post-development school argue that development was always unjust, never worked, and at this point has clearly failed. According to Wolfgang Sachs, a leading member of the post-development school, "the idea of development stands like a ruin in the intellectual landscape" and "it is time to dismantle this mental structure."[1] To cite an example of this "mental structure", development theorists point out how the concept of development has resulted in the hierarchy of developed and underdeveloped nations, where the developed nations are seen as more advanced and superior to the underdeveloped nations that are conceived as inferior, in need of help from the developed nations, and desiring to be like the developed nations. The post-development school of thought points out that the models of development are often ethnocentric (in this case Eurocentric), universalist, and based on western models of industrialization that are unsustainable in this world of limited resources and ineffective for their ignorance of the local, cultural and historical contexts of the peoples to which they are applied. In essence, the problem post-development theorists see in development and its practice is an imbalance of influence or domination by the west. Post development theorists promote more pluralism in ideas about development. Critique of ethnocentrism and universalism[edit] Among the starting points and basic assumptions of post-development thought is the idea that a middle-class, Western lifestyle and all that goes with it (which might include the nuclear family, mass consumption, living in suburbia and extensive private space), may neither be a realistic nor a desirable goal for the majority of the world’s population. In this sense, development is seen as requiring the loss, or indeed the deliberate extermination (ethnocide) of indigenous culture[2] or other psychologically and environmentally rich and rewarding modes of life. As a result, formerly satisfactory ways of life become dissatisfying because development changes people's perception of themselves. Majid Rahnema cites Helena Norberg-Hodge: "To take an example, Helena Norberg-Hodge mentions how the notion of poverty hardly existed in Ladakh when she visited that country for the first time in 1975. Today she says, it has become part of the language. When visiting an outlying village some eight years ago, Helena asked a young Ladakhi where were the poorest houses. 'We have no poor houses in our village,' was the proud reply. Recently Helena saw the same Ladakhi talking to an American tourist and overheard him say, 'if only you could do something for us, we are so poor.'"[3][4] Development is seen as a set of knowledges, interventions and worldviews (in short, discourses) which are also powers: to intervene, to transform and to rule. Post-development critiques challenge the notion of a single path to development and demands acknowledgment of diversity of cultural perspectives and priorities. For example, the politics of defining and satisfying needs is a crucial dimension of development thought, deeply entwined in the concept of agency. But who voices development concerns, what power relations are played out, how do the interests of development "experts" (the World Bank, IMF officials, professionals, and so on) rule the development priorities, and which voices are excluded as a result? The post-development approach attempts to overcome the inequality of this discourse by opening up spaces for non-Western peoples and their concerns. Postdevelopment theory is, above all, a critique of the standard assumptions about progress: who possesses the key to it and how it may be implemented. Alternatives to development[edit] While the postdevelopment school provides a plethora of development critiques, it also considers alternative methods for bringing about positive change. The postdevelopment school proposes a particular vision of society removed from the discourse of development, modernity, politics, cultural and economical influences from the west, and market oriented and centralized authoritarian societies. In his works, Escobar has outlined the common features of post-development thought and societal vision. According to Escobar, the post-development school of thought is interested (in terms of searching for an alternative to development) in "local culture and knowledge; a critical stance toward established scientific discourses; and the defense and promotion of localized, pluralistic grassroots movements." Grassroots movements, Escober argues, are "local, pluralistic, and distrust organized politics and development establishment." Post-development thought takes inspiration from vernacular societies, the informal sector and frugal rather than materialistic lifestyles. Furthermore, post-development theorists advocate for structural changes. According to Escobar, post-developmental thinking believes that the economy must be based around solidarity and reciprocity; policy must focus on direct democracy; and knowledge systems should be traditional, or at least a hybrid of modern and traditional knowledge. James Ferguson[edit] One of the leading anti-development writers, James Ferguson contributed to what John Rapley termed "the most important of the opening salvos" of post-development theory with his article The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho. In The Anti-Politics Machine Ferguson describes the failure of the development project to properly understand the cultural and economic values of the people of Lesotho. This misunderstanding led to misappropriation of resources by the international community and myriad negative consequences for Basotho (residents of Lesotho), prompting Ferguson to comment that "Capitalist interests [...] can only operate through a set of social and cultural structures so complex that the outcome may be only a baroque and unrecognizable transformation of the original intention."[5] In other words, development projects cannot simply create a desired result, but instead have a number of unexpected consequences. Arturo Escobar[edit] Critics of development do not deny the need for change. They argue instead that to enact proper and effective change, change itself must first be conceived in different terms. Arturo Escobar, another leading member of the post-development school, argues: "While social change has probably always been part of the human experience, it was only within the European modernity that 'society', i.e. the whole way of life of a people, was open to empirical analysis and made the subject of planned change. And while communities in the Third World may find that there is a need for some sort of organised or directed change—in part to reverse the damage done by development—this undoubtedly will not take the form of 'designing life' or social engineering. In this long run, this means that categories and meanings have to be redefined; through their innovative political practice, new social movements of various kinds are already embarked on this process of redefining the social, and knowledge itself." Majid Rahnema[edit] Majid Rahnema addresses the question of which path to take directly in his conclusion to the Post-Development Reader. Rahnema admits that it may be true that a large majority of people, whose lives are in fact difficult, do want change. But the answer he suggests is not development but the "end of development". He says that the end of development is not "An end to the search for new possibilities of change, for a relational world of friendship, or for genuine processes of regeneration able to give birth to new forms of solidarity". Rather, Rahnema argues, the "inhumane and the ultimately destructive approach to change is over. It should resemble a call to the 'good people' everywhere to think and work together." Serge Latouche[edit] Serge Latouche is a French emeritus professor in economy at the University of Paris-Sud. A specialist in North-South economic and cultural relations, and in social sciences epistemology, he has developed a critical theory towards economic orthodoxy. He denounces economism, utilitarianism in social sciences, consumer society and the notion of sustainable development. He particularly criticizes the notions of economic efficiency and economic rationalism. He is one of the thinkers and most renowned partisans of the degrowth theory.[6] Latouche has also published in the Revue de Mauss, a French anti-utilitarian journal. Wolfgang Sachs and The Development Dictionary[edit] Wolfgang Sachs is a leading writer in post-development thought. Most of his writing is focused on environmentally sustainable development and the idea that past notions of development are naturally unsustainable practices on our finite planet. However, in 1992 he co-authored and edited The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power which contributed greatly to the compilation of post development literature as a general theory. This manifesto posits that the new era of development that emerged in the 1950s was created by the United States in order to secure its new hegemonic position in the global community. Sachs explains that the concept of "underdevelopment" was actually constructed in Harry S. Truman's 1949 inaugural address, which popularized the term. Sachs argues that the creation of this term was a discrete, strategic move to secure American hegemony by reinforcing the idea that the United States is at the top, and other countries on a lower pillar, of a linear and singular trajectory of development. It created a homogeneous identity for these countries and stripped them of their own diverse characteristics. "It converts participation into a manipulative trick to involve people in struggles for getting what the powerful want to impose on them."[7] The Development Dictionary describes a biological metaphor for development. This biological metaphor was transferred to the social sphere and perpetuated the ideal that there is one natural way to develop into the perfect form. To develop in a manner disparate from the "natural order of things" was to become a disfigured anomaly. This definition held the potential to provide morally ambiguous justification for imperialist behavior and can be connected to colonial discourse and mainstream development theories. Under such categorization, Sachs explains, development was reduced to a simple measurement of the economic growth of per capita production. Sachs issues a cry for public awareness of the "limits of development." He leaves the reader with the idea of the "New Commons" and posits that men and women should begin with this awareness before attempting to introduce new political policies with room for creativity and innovation in diverse development paths. Criticisms[edit] There is a large body of works which are critical of post-development theory and its proponents. It has been noted that post-development theory sees all development as imposed upon the developing world by the West. This dualist perspective of development may be unrealistic, and Marc Edelman notes that a large proportion of development has risen from, rather than been imposed upon, the developing world.[8] Citing Jonathan Crush's point that "Development, for all its power to speak and to control the terms of speaking, has never been impervious to challenge and resistance, nor, in response, to reformulation and change"[9] Ray Kiely argues that "The post-development idea is thus part of a long history within the development discourse."[10] In short, Kiely argues that post-development theory is merely the latest version of a set of criticisms that have long been evident within writing and thought in the field of development. Development has always been about choices, Kiely explains. Choices with resulting losers and winners, dilemmas and destruction, as well as creative possibility. There are a number of more fundamental objections to the postdevelopment school. The first is that it overstates its case. A rejection of all development is a rejection of the possibility for material advancement and transformation. It ignores the tangible transformations in life opportunities and health and material well-being that has been evident in parts of the developing world. Moreover, development itself is so varied and carries so many meanings that critiques need to be specific about their intention when they claim to be "post- development". By damning development all together, post-development theorists fail to notice the heterogeneity within development discourse. They categorize all development under the umbrella of Western hegemony, contradictively applying the same sort of essentialist generalization post-development theorists reject. Critics also argue that post-development perpetuates cultural relativism: the idea that cultural beliefs and practices can be judged only by those who practice them. By accepting all cultural behaviors and beliefs as valid and rejecting a universal standard for living and understanding life, critics of post-development argue, post-development represents the opposite extreme of universalism, extreme relativism. Such a relativist extreme, rather than besting extreme universalism, has equally dangerous implications. John Rapley points out that "rejection of essentialism rests itself on an essentialist claim – namely, that all truth is constructed and arbitrary[...]"[11] Kiely also argues that by rejecting a top-down, centralized approach to development and promoting development through local means, post-development thought perpetuates neo-liberal ideals. Kiely remarks that "The argument - upheld by dependency and post-development theory - that the First World needs the Third World, and vice versa, rehearses neo-liberal assumptions that the world is an equal playing field in which all nation states have the capacity to compete equally[...]"[12] In other words, making locals responsible for their own predicament, post-development unintentionally agrees with neo-liberalist ideology that favors decentralized projects and ignores the possibility of assisting impoverished demographics, instead making the fallacious assumption that such demographics must succeed on their own initiative alone. Kiely notes that not all grassroots movements are progressive. Post-development is seen to empower anti-modern fundamentalists and traditionalists, who may hold non-progressive and oppressive values.[13] Notable development critics[edit] Edward Abbey John Africa Stafford Beer (Viable System Model) Charles A.

Agnes de Mille
Agnes George de Mille (September 18, 1905 – October 7, 1993) was an American dancer and choreographer.
Agnes de Mille Agnes de Mille (1941) Born Agnes George de Mille (1905-09-18)September 18, 1905 New York City, New York, USA Died October 7, 1993(1993-10-07) (aged 88) New York City, New York, USA Occupation Choreographer, dancer Years active 1910s–1990s Agnes George de Mille (September 18, 1905 – October 7, 1993) was an American dancer and choreographer. Contents 1 Early years 2 Career 3 Writings 4 Personal life 5 Legacy 6 References 7 External links Early years[edit] Agnes de Mille was born in New York City into a well-connected family of theater professionals. Her father William C. deMille and her uncle Cecil B. DeMille were both Hollywood directors. Her mother, Anna Angela George, was the daughter of Henry George, the economist. On her father's side, Agnes was the granddaughter of playwright Henry Churchill de Mille and Matilda Beatrice deMille. She had a love for acting and originally wanted to be an actress, but was told that she was "not pretty enough", so she turned her attention to dance. As a child, she had longed to dance, but dance at this time was considered more of an activity, rather than a viable career option, so her parents refused to allow her to dance. She did not seriously consider dancing as a career until after she graduated from college. When de Mille's younger sister was prescribed ballet classes to cure her flat feet, de Mille joined her. De Mille lacked flexibility and technique, though, and did not have a dancer's body. Classical ballet was the most widely known dance form at this time, and de Mille's apparent lack of ability limited her opportunities. She taught herself from watching film stars on the set with her father in Hollywood; these were more interesting for her to watch than perfectly turned out legs, and she developed strong character work and compelling performances. One of de Mille’s earliest jobs, thanks to her father’s connections, was choreographing the Cecil B. DeMille film Cleopatra (1934). DeMille's dance director LeRoy Prinz clashed with the younger de Mille. Her uncle always deferred to Prinz, even after agreeing to his niece's dances in advance, and Agnes de Mille left the film.[1] De Mille graduated from UCLA with a degree in English where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, and in 1933 moved to London to study with Dame Marie Rambert, eventually joining Rambert's company, The Ballet Club, later Ballet Rambert, and Antony Tudor's London Ballet. Career[edit] De Mille began her association with the fledgling American Ballet Theatre (then called the Ballet Theatre) in 1939, but her first significant work, Rodeo (1942) with the score by Aaron Copland, was staged for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Although de Mille continued to choreograph nearly up to the time of her death—her final ballet, The Other, was completed in 1992—most of her later works have dropped out of the ballet repertoire. Besides Rodeo, two other de Mille ballets are performed on a regular basis, Three Virgins and a Devil (1934) adapted from a tale by Giovanni Boccaccio, and Fall River Legend (1948) based on the life of Lizzie Borden. On the strength of Rodeo, de Mille was hired to choreograph the musical show Oklahoma! (1943). The dream ballet, in which dancers Marc Platt, Katherine Sergava, and George Church doubled for the leading actors, successfully integrated dance into the musical's plot. Instead of functioning as an interlude or divertissement, the ballet provided key insights into the heroine's emotional troubles. De Mille went on to choreograph over a dozen other musicals, most notably Bloomer Girl (1944), Carousel (1945), Brigadoon (1947, for which she was co-recipient of the inaugural Tony Award for Best Choreography), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1949), Paint Your Wagon (1951), The Girl in Pink Tights (1954), Goldilocks (1957), and 110 in the Shade (1963). De Mille's success on Broadway did not translate into success in Hollywood. Her only significant film credit is Oklahoma! (1955). She was not invited to recreate her choreography for either Brigadoon (1954) or Carousel (1956). Nevertheless, her two specials for the Omnibus TV series entitled "The Art of Ballet" and "The Art of Choreography" (both televised in 1956) were immediately recognized as landmark attempts to bring serious dance to the attention of a broad public. During his presidency, John F. Kennedy appointed de Mille as a member of the National Advisory Committee on the Arts, the predecessor to the National Endowment for the Arts, of which she was also appointed to by president L.B. Johnson after its activation. [2] Her love for acting played a very important role in her choreography. De Mille revolutionized musical theatre by creating choreography which not only conveyed the emotional dimensions of the characters but enhanced the plot. Her choreography, as a reflection of her awareness of acting, reflected the angst and turmoil of the characters instead of simply focusing on a dancer's physical technique. De Mille regularly worked with a recognizable core group of dancers, including Virginia Bosler, Gemze de Lappe, Lidija Franklin, Jean Houloose, Dania Krupska, Bambi Linn, Joan McCracken, James Mitchell, Mavis Ray, and, at American Ballet Theatre, Sallie Wilson. Krupska, Mitchell, and Ray served as de Mille's assistant choreographers, while de Lappe has taken an active role in preserving de Mille's work. In 1973, de Mille founded the Agnes de Mille Dance Theatre, which she later revived as Heritage Dance Theatre. De Mille developed a love for public speaking, becoming an outspoken advocate for dance in America. She spoke in front of Congress three times: once in the Senate, once in the House of Representatives, and once for the Committee for Medical Research. She was interviewed in the television documentary series Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film (1980) [3] primarily discussing the work of her uncle Cecil B. DeMille. Writings[edit] DeMille's 1951 memoir, Dance to the Piper, was translated into five languages. It was reissued in 2015 by New York Review Books.[4] De Mille was a lifelong friend of modern dance legend Martha Graham. De Mille, in 1992, published Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham, a biography of Graham that de Mille worked on for more than thirty years.[5] After suffering from a near fatal stroke, she went on to write five books: Reprieve (which outlined the experience), Who Was Henry George?, Where the Wings Grow, America Dances, Portrait Gallery, and Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham. She also wrote And Promenade Home, To a Young Dancer, The Book of Dance, Lizzie Borden: Dance of Death, Dance in America, Russian Journals, and Speak to Me, Dance with Me. Personal life[edit] De Mille married Walter Prude on June 14, 1943. They had one child, Jonathan, born in 1946. Her hobbies included collecting fine porcelain and research on the history of clothes, something at which she was an expert. She suffered a stroke on stage in 1975, but recovered. She died in 1993 of a second stroke in her Greenwich Village apartment.[6] Legacy[edit] Agnes De Mille was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1973.[7] De Mille's many other awards include the Tony Award for Best Choreography (1947, for Brigadoon), the Handel Medallion for achievement in the arts (1976), an honor from the Kennedy Center (1980), an Emmy for her work in The Indomitable de Mille (1980), Drama Desk Special Award (1986) and, in 1986, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts.[8] De Mille also has received seven honorary degrees from various colleges and universities. At present, the only commercially available examples of de Mille's choreography are parts one and two of Rodeo by the American Ballet Theater,[9] Fall River Legend (filmed in 1989 by the Dance Theatre of Harlem) and Oklahoma!

Dutch Indies country house
Dutch Indies country houses (known as landhuizen, landhuis or thuyen) are Dutch colonial country houses in the Dutch Indies, now Indonesia. Many country houses were built by the Dutch in its colonial settlements during the 18th century, such as Galle, Cape Town, and Curaçao, but none as solidly built and as grandeur as the Dutch colonial country houses of Batavia; much of Batavia's reputation as 'Queen of the East' rested on the grandeur of these 18th-century mansion.[1]

Dutch Indies country houses (known as landhuizen, landhuis or thuyen) are Dutch colonial country houses in the Dutch Indies, now Indonesia. Many country houses were built by the Dutch in its colonial settlements during the 18th century, such as Galle, Cape Town, and Curaçao, but none as solidly built and as grandeur as the Dutch colonial country houses of Batavia; much of Batavia's reputation as 'Queen of the East' rested on the grandeur of these 18th-century mansion.[1] Architecturally, in the beginning, they were conceived as replicas of the Dutch architecture. Later, the design include features from Javanese vernacular architecture, partly to response to the tropical climate. This distinctive type of architecture, fusion of Western and Javanese architecture, became known later as the Indies Style from the Dutch East Indies. The Indies Style is the first form of a fusion of Dutch and local architecture which gave rise to subsequent style of early Dutch Rationalist architecture in Indonesia. Despite the heritage of this structure and its protected status, many of the Indies country houses were left to deteriorate or completely demolished, often due to lack of maintenance management.[1] Many of these houses were within the complex owned by the National Police, often transformed into a dormitory albeit with improper conservation method. Contents 1 History 2 The Indies Style 2.1 Dutch Style country houses 2.2 Transitional Dutch Indies country houses 2.3 Indies style country houses 3 Decline of the country houses 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References History[edit] In 17th century Netherlands, increasing importance of Holland as a major maritime nation with a growing commercial empire overseas, particularly in the East, had generated capital for the merchant classes of Amsterdam. These increasingly wealthy merchants began to invest their profits in a second residence outside Amsterdam. This second residence, or landhuizen, ranged from modest rural retreats to luxurious manor houses, and typically seats along the river Amstel and Vecht. In Batavia, similar trend occurred in middle 18th century. When Batavia grew increasingly unhealthy during the 18th century, wealthy Dutch East India Company officials were the first to flee Batavia and build for themselves grand country houses in the surrounding countryside, typically situated between the rivers and roads that led into Batavia. The officials of the Dutch East India Company were able to build country houses outside the walled city Batavia when the Ommelanden (the hinterland that lay immediately beyond the walled city) had been pacified and kept free from attacks by Javanese insurgents who were trying to evict the Dutch occupiers. This was achieved by establishing a circular line of fortified field posts at places like Antjol, Jacatra, Noordwijk, Rijswijk, Angke and Vijfhoek; most of which were established in the middle of 17th century. The first houses were wooden structures, but as time went by, these became opulent country houses in luxurious pleasure gardens, often with its own music pavilion and belfry. The Indies Style[edit] The Indies Style appeared very pronounced in the country houses of the Dutch Indies. This new architectural style appeared in late 18th-century and gradually become more developed as it try to conform with the tropical climate of Java and Sumatra. The style can be divided into three major prototype: Dutch Style country houses, Transitional Dutch Indies country houses, and Indies style country houses.[2] Many of these Batavian country houses are completely demolished but at least one prototype of the three major style survives as of 2015.[1] Dutch Style country houses[edit] Reiner de Kerk house, now known as the National Archives building, one of the few Indies country houses of this type that survives to this day. Country houses in the Dutch Style (Nederlandse stijl) were popular between 1730-1770.[2] It is typically a two-storeyed country houses of almost exact replicas of their Dutch counterparts. The Dutch influence are the hipped roof, closed and solidly built facade, and high windows. This country houses are often equipped with belfries, musical pavilion, and a European pleasure garden without any consideration of its tropical surrounding.[2] The only concession to the tropical climate is the relatively large roof overhang compared with the original Dutch country houses. Also, unlike their Dutch counterparts, Batavian estates included extensive ancillary quarters to accommodate the large number of servants, often in the rear of the house.[1] The interior was usually larger than its Dutch counterpart, with ceiling that is much taller. Samples of country houses belonging to this style are Weltevreden country house, Groeneveld House in Condet, Reinier de Klerk country house (now the building of the National Archives of Indonesia), and Jan Schreuder country house.[2] Weltevreden country house (1761) built by governor general Jacob Mossel Groeneveld estate (1760), instrumental in the growing of the Betawi Condet culture. Interior of National Archive building showing one of the four heavily-ornate doors. Transitional Dutch Indies country houses[edit] Rumah Cililitan Besar, the prototype of the Transitional Dutch Indies country houses, can still be seen today, but in a neglected condition. Also known as Nederlands-Indische stijl,[2] the style appeared between 1750-1800. The structure and form of this type of country house shows a process of acculturation to the tropical climate on the part of the Dutch. It is still a two-storey structure, but the facades are protected from solar radiation and heavy rain by extremely large overhanging roof which projects on all sides of the house. The roof profile resembles the local joglo-style roof traditionally reserved for Javanese noblemen. The upper floor is usually reached by external staircase and often the central portion was left open to encourage maximum ventilation; as well as tall windows with louvered shutters. The style was also popular in Sumatra. Samples of this type of country houses is Rumah Cililitan Besar (1775), which still survives but seriously deteriorates.[1] Other examples are Pondok Gedeh country house and Cengkareng country house.[2] Landhuis Pondok Gede shows gradual evolution from the previous style into the transitional style. Landhuis Cengkareng was built in 1760 by Michiel Romp. A residency in Palembang, now Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Museum A house in North Sumatra. Indies style country houses[edit] Landhuis Depan in Batavia. Also known as Indo-European house (Indo Europeesche Stijl)[3] or Indische stijl,[2] this type of country houses appear between 1790-1820. The form of these country houses represents the perfect expression of the intermingling of Dutch and indigenous (Javanese) architecture. Country houses of this type consisted of a single storey with front verandahs (pringgitan) and rear verandahs (gadri), covered by a high, pitched roof which extended over the verandahs. Often the verandahs were connected to side galleries for full climatic protection. The verandah often had potted palms, cool concrete or marble tiles covered with split bamboo mats. The western reference appears in the neo-classical Tuscan columns supporting the large roof overhang and the decorated doors and windows.[1] Many of these original Indies country houses have been demolished, very few of the original have survived today. The style was replicated all around the archipelago in later period. One of the few surviving example is Cimanggis house, albeit in a seriously deteriorating condition with its roof collapsed somewhere before 2013. Other examples are Japan House (built for Andries Hartsinck by the end of 18th century, demolished in 1996), Tjitrap (Citeureup) house, Telukpucung house and Camis house.[1] The front verandah of the landhuis Depan in Batavia. Decline of the country houses[edit] With the dissolution of the VOC, the country houses were becoming less popular. During the 19th century, there were two groups of architectural movement in the Dutch East Indies: the universally accepted but steadily decreasing in popularity neoclassical style, appropriate for a colonial empire; and the Modernist, which gives rise to a neo-vernacular school of architecture which combined with Art Deco to create a new modern tropical style dubbed as New Indies Style.[4] Whereas the earlier Indies Style were essentially Indonesian houses with European trim, by the early 20th century, the trend was for modernist influences being expressed in essentially European buildings with Indonesian trim. Practical measures carried over from the earlier Indies Style, which responded to the Indonesian climate, included overhanging eaves, larger windows and ventilation in the walls.[5] See also[edit] Architecture of Indonesia Colonial architecture of Indonesia List of colonial buildings and structures in Jakarta Notes[edit] ^ a b c d e f g Gunawan Tjahjono 1998, pp. 110-1. ^ a b c d e f g Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990, pp. 7-11. ^ Schoppert & Damais 1997, pp. 72-7. ^ Gunawan Tjahjono 1998, pp. 120. ^ Schoppert & Damais 1997, pp. 104-5.

The first locomotive entered the rebuilding process in November 2015. 10 of these locomotives are now in service as of March 2016. All of the SD70ACus will be rebuilt with the latest EMD cab which meets current FRA crashworthiness standards. The Siemens electronics will be replaced with Mitsubishi electronics. The rebuild also includes the installation of Ultra Cab II, locomotive speed limiter (LSL), and cab signals. The trucks will be rebuilt only as-needed and they are not getting traction motors swapped out. History[edit] An EMD SD9043MAC, the units that are being rebuilt into the SD70ACu. The units that will be rebuilt are all ex-Union Pacific EMD SD90MAC locomotives. The SD90MAC was introduced in 1995 and was designed to use the new 16-cylinder, 6,000-horsepower (4,500 kW) H-engine. However, technical problems with the 265 engine resulted in the locomotives being delivered with the 4,300 hp (3,210 kW) 16-cylinder 710G used in EMD's SD70MAC. UP referred to these locomotives as SD9043MACs, and EMD planned to offer customers the option to upgrade them to the 6,000 hp (4,470 kW) 265 engine at a later date. EMD's upgrade program, however, was never carried out due to unresolved reliability issues with the 265. Over 400 SD90MAC locomotives fitted with the 4,300 hp (3,210 kW) 710 engine were built. 100 units originally ordered by Union Pacific were sold to Norfolk Southern as part of the SD70ACu rebuild program. EMD is responsible for delivering the locomotives, and as of November 2015, all units have been delivered. They are numbered 7229-7328.

Co-investor Xu Mingbo was also recognized (USD$1.1 billion).[6][7] Family[edit] The Xu family are prominent investors in diversified industries. In addition to controlling stakes in Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group and Beijing SL Pharmaceuticals, Jingren chairs YRPG's 22 subsidiaries across Southeast Asia.[8] His son Xu Haoyu is the largest private shareholder of China Eastern Airlines, based in Shanghai, China.[9] Xu's daughter, a biotechnological researcher and practicing physician in the United States, negotiated the sale of majority ownership in research subsidiary ShangPharma,[10] and holds board partnerships in China Telecom[11] as well as the pharmaceutical division of Fosun International Holdings. Her son, Aaron, is currently an undergraduate student in the United States. He retains a minority stake in re-branded ShangPharma/ChemPartner,[12] and in 2015 introduced the group's new research centers in Shanghai and San Francisco alongside CEO Michael Hui.[13][14] Shang also acquired an undisclosed percentage of French resort operator Club Med after funding a portion of the reportedly 80% premium that new owner Fosun International Holdings paid following a protracted bidding war.[15][16][17] The family were noted victims of the 2015 Chinese stock market crash, during which they lost approximately 40% of their previously estimated USD$8 billion combined net worth.[18] Despite this, Xu Jingren and his relatives continue to be mentioned as one of China's top "vampire billionaire" families, with significantly concealed investments designed to keep a low profile in the face of intensive government business and financial regulation.[19][20][21] Unofficial estimates have tabbed their wealth as high as USD$13 billion.

Alex Cable
Alex Cable is an American optical engineer, inventor and entrepreneur. He is the founder of optical equipment manufacturer Thorlabs.
Alex Cable is an American optical engineer, inventor and entrepreneur. He is the founder of optical equipment manufacturer Thorlabs. Contents 1 Early life and education 2 Career 3 Academic work 4 Personal life 5 References Early life and education[edit] Cable was born in Chester Borough, New Jersey, and grew up in nearby Freehold Township.[1][2] As a child, he enjoyed hiking and camping in Sussex County.[2] Cable dropped out of high school.[1] Cable's first job was as a dishwasher in a restaurant.[3] He became chef and then restaurant manager with an eye toward fulfilling his entrepreneurial desires by opening his own restaurant.[4][3] However, he soon realized that the outlook for a restaurant business did not meet his expectations and left the industry.[4] He also worked briefly as a machinist, farm manager, and printer.[3][5] Cable returned to school, attending the County College of Morris.[1] He subsequently earned a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Rutgers University, and a graduate degree in material science from the Stevens Institute of Technology.[3] Career[edit] Out of Rutgers, Cable was recruited by Steven Chu to work in his lab at Bell Labs in the spring of 1984.[6] According to Cable, Chu especially liked Cable's diverse work history.[5] Cable was official employed as a "technician", but Chu described him as "unofficially  ... a super-graduate student". At Bell Labs, Cable became involved in a series of experiments on low-temperature atom manipulation called "optical molasses". In late 1987, Chu left Bell labs to take a position at Stanford University.[6] Chu attempted to persuade Cable to join him at Stanford, but after "weeks of agonizing over the tempting offer", Cable declined the offer. Cable instead chose to pursue an entrepreneurial career, having only planned a brief stay at Bell Labs.[4][5] Cable had recently built a small 900 sq ft (84 m2). home in Freehold.[5] Together with a college friend, he built two scanning tunneling microscopes for DuPont in his bedroom.[4][5] The first microscope sold for about $50,000, leaving $20,000 of profit after expenses.[5] Cable hoped to make a business out of it, entering the emerging market for the newly-invented microscope.[4] Cable's second microscope was less profitable. The business did not appear to be viable due to limited customers and limited working capital, so Cable abandoned the idea.[5] Instead, he took "a more traditional approach", buying a milling machine which he used to design and build optomechanical parts.[4] Selling the parts proved fruitful and also more enjoyable for Cable.[4][5] In November 1989, he left Bell Labs to pursue the business full time, naming it Thorlabs.[4] He returned to Sussex County, and has made an effort to keep the business headquartered there due to his love for the area.[2] By 2004, Thorlabs had estimated annual sales of $50 million and was expanding into Europe.[4] By 2010, sales had reached $125 million annually.[1] As of 2013, the company produced approximately 20,000 unique products and employed 1,000 people.[2] According to data published by Gale Business Insights, the company had estimated sales of $199.8 million in 2013, the most recent full-year available.[7] Cable is a founder and director of several photonics companies including KDD FiberLabs of Tokyo, Menlo Systems GmbH, and Stratophase Ltd.[3] He is also a director of the Boston Micromachines Corporation. In 2010, Cable founded Idesta Quantum Electronics.[8] He sits on the advisory board of the Center for Automation Technologies and Systems at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.[3] Academic work[edit] While working at Bell Labs, Cable was part of a "lunchtime conversation" that led to a number of experiments which investigated atomic behavior at very low temperatures involving himself, Arthur Ashkin, John Bjorkholm, Steven Chu, and Leo Holberg.[2] Subsequently, Cable was listed as a co-author on three papers in Physical Review Letters starting in 1985 that collectively have been cited more than 3700 times.[9] The first of those papers, "Three-dimensional viscous confinement and cooling of atoms by resonance radiation pressure", led to Chu and his Stanford colleagues winning the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics.[10] The paper was selected as one of the journal's greatest milestones by Physical Review Letters' editors in 2008. The work has led to substantial improvement in the accuracy of atomic clocks and the discovery of the Bose–Einstein condensate.[10] In 2013, Cable met with several academics to explore the possibility that breath analysis could detect diseases after reading about dogs that were reported to detect cancer in their owners.[2] His h-index is 24, according to Google Scholar.[9] Personal life[edit] Cable is a fitness buff, who participates in endurance sports as a form of stress release. "Competing in sports makes me a better person in business. It translates back and forth and frees me to manage what otherwise could be a very stressful life," he remarked.[2] Through Thorlabs, he advocates for personal fitness through community events.[2] References[edit] ^ a b c d Kathy Stevens (October 4, 2010).

In 1997, the trio moved to Glasgow, where Neil studied Electronics with Music at the University of Glasgow. He also Studied Film and TV for a year before leaving to pursue music full-time. By then, Simon's musical tastes had expanded; In 2000, the band were spotted at the Unsigned Bands stage at T in the Park by a Beggars Banquet representative. Soon after, the band was signed to the independent Beggar's Banquet. Biffy Clyro have since released seven albums, signed to a major record label, and toured relentlessly. Neil has stated that Biffy Clyro lyrics often come from phrases he writes down in a notebook he keeps by his bed.

The first single from the second album, "Kid Gloves" was released on 9 February 2009. Solo career[edit] Neil performs under the name ZZC.

Contents 1 Service history 1.1 Gallery 2 References 3 External links Service history[edit] During the following year Essex cruised to Liberia and along the west coast of Africa and in 1878-79 joined the South Atlantic Squadron. While at Monrovia, Liberia, on 31 October 1877, Ordinary Seaman John Millmore and First Class Fireman Henry Lakin Simpson rescued a shipmate from drowning, for which they were later awarded the Medal of Honor.[1] Essex sailed on the Pacific Station from November 1881 to December 1882 and thence on the Asiatic Station for two years during which she took on board Captain S. H. Morrison and crew members of the shipwrecked Ranier. Following repairs' she returned to the Asiatic Station under command of Commander T.F. Jewell in June 1886 and in October anchored at Ponape, Caroline Islands, to afford protection to American missionaries during a native uprising. She returned to New York via the Suez Canal and was placed out of commission in May 1889. Regarded as one of the finest ships of the fleet, Essex was designated next as a training ship. A three-month cruise with cadets at the Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1893 was followed by two lengthy tours to train naval apprentices (January 1894-April 1898, and September 1898 to December 1903.) Essex was lent to the Ohio Naval Militia (1904–16) and served in the Ninth Naval District from 1917 to 1926. During that period she underwent a major refit, receiving new boilers and engine. The number of masts was reduced to two, and were not used as a means of propulsion. The Naval Reserve of the State of Minnesota and the Minnesota Naval Militia used her as training and receiving ship from 1921 until 27 October 1930 when she was stricken from the Navy List. She was sold for scrap on 23 December 1930 and subsequently burned near Duluth: the National Register of Historic Places lists her remains.

Charles Belden
Charles Josiah Belden (November 16, 1887, San Francisco, California – February 1, 1966, St. Petersburg, Florida) was a photographer and rancher who was famous for his visceral photographs of the area around Meetseetse, Wyoming.
For other people named Charles Belden, see Charles Belden (disambiguation). Charles Josiah Belden (November 16, 1887, San Francisco, California – February 1, 1966, St. Petersburg, Florida) was a photographer and rancher who was famous for his visceral photographs of the area around Meetseetse, Wyoming. Belden was born in San Francisco[1] into a wealthy California family. His grandfather, Josiah Belden, was an early California pioneer who made millions in San Francisco real estate and was the first Mayor of San Jose. After graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles Belden bought his first camera to record a European tour with his school friend, Eugene Phelps.[2] The highlight of the tour was a journey through Russia in Belden's 1908 Packard, the first automobile to make such a trip in the country. After the trip, Belden went to work as a cowboy on the Phelps (Pitchfork) Ranch in Wyoming.[1] In 1912, Belden married Eugene's sister, Frances. The couple had three children, Annice, Margot, and Mary Elizabeth, who died while still a toddler. Eugene's father died in 1922, leaving Eugene and Charles to take over management of the Pitchfork Ranch. Belden's 1921–1940 photographs of the Pitchfork Ranch were widely published, including in The Saturday Evening Post, National Geographic, and on the cover of Life magazine.[3] Airplanes became a fascination for Belden. In the late 1920s, Charles became involved in raising antelope and sending them by airplane to zoos around the world, including some to Germany in the Hindenburg.[4] He helped to pioneer the process of planting fish from the air and filmed the experience for future reference. In addition, he helped the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission conduct a census of wildlife herd populations using aerial photographs. Estate taxes, mismanagement, and an agricultural depression that began in 1921 took their toll on the Pitchfork and the ranch fell into decline. To meet expenses, in the 1930s the family turned their home into a dude ranch, but this response did not stop the financial drain. After many years of strained relations, Charles divorced Frances in 1940 and moved to Florida with a new wife, Verna Steele Belden. Charles Belden died in 1966 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in St. Petersburg, Florida.[1] References[edit] ^ a b c "The Belden Museum". Meeteetse Museums. Retrieved 2015-02-12.  ^ G. B. Dobson.

Entry to the junior choirs, training choirs and National Youth Choir is by audition. Around 600 people aged 9–22 attend auditions which take place in venues across Britain in November each year. Usually, around half of those auditioning are offered places. The National Youth Chamber Choir is formed of eight core members aged 22-25 selected by open audition for a Fellowship Programme. Forming a mixed-voice octet, they take part in a year-long programme of performance and supporting project work to develop skills, including choral leadership and profile development. Each Fellowship member is given £4k. Further members of the Chamber Choir are selected by audition from within the National Youth Choir to take part in performances. NYCGB have collaborated with a wide range of musicians, been involved in various recordings and performed on tours as well as at many venues across the UK. NYCGB performed with George Shearing and the King's Singers at the Barbican Centre, and again with the King's Singers for their 25th anniversary and the National Youth Choir's 21st anniversary. The National Youth Choir performed on the recording of Karl Jenkins's The Armed Man: A Mass for Peace and gave a concert at the Royal Festival Hall in October 2010 to celebrate 10 years since the recording of the CD. They have collaborated with the National Youth Jazz Collective, with drum and bass star, Goldie, with SAMYO (the National Youth Orchestra for Indian Music) and with leading folk musicians Will Lang and Niopha Keegan. NYCGB also performed at Twickenham Stadium for the Rugby Football Union England internationals and Cardiff's Millennium Stadium for the 2006 FA Cup Final.

Zenonas Ivinskis (May 25, 1908 in Kauš?nai village, near Plung? – December 24, 1971 in Bonn, Germany) was a noted Lithuanian historian. Contents 1 Education 2 Emigration 3 Important works 4 External links Education[edit] Ivinskis studied at Telšiai and Plung? gymnasiums. In 1925 he entered the University of Lithuania to study philosophy, but later changed the subject to history. In 1929, Ivinskis received a grant to continue his studies in Germany. There, under the direction of prof. Albert Brackmann, he received a Ph.D. for his thesis Geschichte des Bauerstandes in Litauen (English: History of the Conditions of Lithuanian Farmers) in 1932. In 1933 in Gda?sk he was habilitated for his work Lietuvi? ir pr?s? prekybiniai santykiai pirmojoje XVI a. pus?je (English: Lithuanian and Prussian trade in the first half of the 16th century). After returning to Lithuania he was drafted into the army. During his free time, he gave lectures at the Vytautas Magnus University and in 1940 became an extraordinary professor. In that year he was invited to work at the Vilnius University. He served as the dean of Faculty of Theology–Philosophy at the Vytautas Magnus University from 1941 to 1942. For his active public defense of university autonomy, the Nazis listed him among other prominent public figures to be transferred to Stutthof concentration camp. Ivinskis was saved from death because he was ill, and was hospitalized for half a year. Emigration[edit] In 1944, Ivinskis retreated to the West. Unlike most other Lithuanian refugees, he did not emigrate to the United States and chose to live in Germany. He gave lectures as Gastprofessor at Baltisches Forchungsinstitut in Bonn, and from 1963 taught the history of Eastern Europe at Bonn University. The next year he received his second habilitation in Lithuanian and Polish history and was appointed as a full-time professor. While living in Germany he often traveled to Rome, and conducted research at the Vatican archives. Ivinskis contributed to the Lithuanian encyclopedias published in Boston.

Tommy Burks
Tommy Burks (May 22, 1940 – October 19, 1998) was a farmer and Democratic Party politician in Tennessee, United States. He served in the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1970 until 1978, and in the Tennessee State Senate from 1978 until his assassination in 1998.[1]

He served in the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1970 until 1978, and in the Tennessee State Senate from 1978 until his assassination in 1998.[1] Biography[edit] Born in Cookeville, Tennessee, Burks was one of the most conservative Democrats in the state legislature. He opposed the teaching of evolution in school science classes (twice introducing legislation to restrict its teaching), legal abortion, gambling, and a state lottery. His views seemed to have been very popular and in line with a large number of voters within his rural district. Burks was an energetic legislator who almost never missed a floor or committee session. It is reported that he would on some occasions arrive at a session having already gotten up on his farm, delivered a load of hogs to Knoxville (approximately 90 miles east of his home) and then driven to the State Capitol in Nashville (100 miles west of his home and 190 miles west of Knoxville). Despite the 100-mile distance, and unlike most legislators from parts of the state a considerable distance from Nashville, Burks made it a practice to go home to his district and his farm almost every night, even during legislative sessions. Assassination[edit] Burks was assassinated by his Republican Party opponent Byron Looper less than a month before his likely re-election. Burks was shot and killed by Looper on Burks' property. An eyewitness to the murder helped seal the conviction of Looper, the Putnam County Tax Assessor at the time. Burks' widow, Charlotte, ran for his seat and won, becoming the first Tennessee State Senator to win as a write-in candidate and one of very few American politicians to win as a write-in candidate ever. She won subsequent elections in 2002, 2006, and 2010. The gun used to kill Burks was never found, and is suspected of being thrown out of Looper's car window along I-40 between Monterey and Cookeville following the murder. Interstate 40 through Wilson, Smith, Putnam, and Cumberland counties is named the "Tommy Burks Memorial Highway". Notes[edit] ^ http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/burket-burnet.html

(August 2012) Susan Shurin, M.D. Susan Shurin, M.D. (born 1944) is currently Senior Adviser, National Cancer Institute. From 2006-2014, she served as Deputy and Acting Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Contents 1 Career 2 Education and Research 3 Memberships 4 References Career[edit] Before joining the NHLBI, Dr. Shurin was Professor of Pediatrics and Oncology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio; Director of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital; Director of Pediatric Oncology at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center; and Vice President and Secretary of the Corporation at Case Western Reserve University. Dr. Shurin joined the NHLBI as Deputy Director in February 2006, coming from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Dr. Shurin served as Acting Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) October and December 2009, while also serving as the Deputy Director of the NHLBI. In December 2009, Dr. Shurin was named acting director of the NHLBI and served in this role until August 2012. As Deputy Director, Dr. Shurin directly managed the $1.6B clinical research portfolio of the NHLBI; as Acting Director, she managed the full $3B annual budget of the Institute, and collaborated with other Institutes and Centers at the NIH. She led the trans-NIH development of policies for sharing genomic data obtained using taxpayer funds, and developed a global health program in non-communicable diseases, focusing on cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. She led renovations of the NHLBI-supported sickle cell disease research programs to direct support enhance patient benefit from research. In July, 2014, Dr. Shurin retired from the NHLBI and joined the National Cancer Institute's Center for Global Health as a Senior Adviser to the Center for Global Health. In this capacity, she continues engagement in global biomedical research capacity building, especially in low and LMIC settings, with a focus on cancer prevention and treatment. She currently resides in San Diego, California. Education and Research[edit] Dr. Shurin received her education and medical training at Harvard University and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Her laboratory research focused on the physiology of phagocyte function, recognition and killing of pathogens; mechanisms of hemolysis, red blood cell destruction; and iron overload, a serious chronic condition in which the body absorbs too much iron leading to a buildup in organ tissues. In the late 1970s, Dr. Shurin led studies which resulted in the development of desferrioxamine as a chelator to manage transfusional iron overload in chronically transfused persons with thalassemia. Widespread application of this therapy has dramatically transformed the outcome of thalassemia across the globe. Dr. Shurin has been active in clinical research in many aspects of pediatric hematology-oncology, including participation in the Children’s Cancer Group (CCG), now the Children's Oncology Group, as well as multiple studies of sickle cell disease and hemostasis. She also served on the Executive Committee of the CCG and founded and chaired the CCG Bioethics Committee. Dr. Shurin co-chaired the Physician Scientist Workforce Working Group of the Advisory Committee to the NIH director in 2013-14,[1][2] and remains involved in implementation of recommendations. Memberships[edit] Dr. Shurin serves on multiple NIH advisory panels. She has been on the boards or in leadership positions of numerous local and national professional organizations, including the American Board of Pediatrics, the American Pediatric Society and the American Society of Hematology, of which she is the Treasurer. She served on the board of the Global Alliance for Chronic Disease (gacd.org), an alliance of public funders of biomedical research in non-communicable diseases, which she chaired for two years.

On a clear day, it is possible to see the mountains across the sea. Tara includes Mount Tara and Mount Kyoga, which are two of the highest mountains in Ky?sh? and part of the Tara Mountains. Tara is composed of two traditional — and to a lesser extent, linguistic — sections, which were once independent towns: Tara (??) and ?ura (??). Tara is located quite close to the Kashima Gatalympics, which takes place near Hizen-Iida station. Aerial view of ?ura bay ?ura harbor is the main port of entry via sea. Significant locations[edit] Famous, tourist, and historic sites of note include: Kinsenji (temple) Once had influence on shrines throughout Ky?sh?, though it is now literally a shell of its former glory (see legends below) Takezaki Kanze Onji (temple) Culturally one of the most influential areas in Tara (see festivals, below) Tara Takezaki onsen One of the few sources of tourism in modern times Shirahama beach; Small and littered with sharp shells, yet facilities exist and a sea-center is close by with recreational activities such as jet-skiing Kenkou no Mori Park ("forest of health") A fairly large park in the middle of the mountains Camp Nakayama Camping ground with cabins (open for a short period each year) and a trail to Mount Tara and other important areas in the Tara mountains Mount Tara (???, tara dake?) and the Tara mountains Mount Tara is one of the tallest mountains in Ky?sh?. Mount Ky?ga (???, ky?ga take?) Taller than mount Tara, making it the tallest in the prefecture. If one is traveling by car, it is more readily accessible from Kashima or ?mura, though a ridgeline exists between it and mount Tara that hikers often use. Takezaki Castle Ruins Degraded into not much more than a wall; its purpose was once to be a lookout for invasions from Nagasaki Takezaki Castle Observatory Re-creation of the original Takezaki Castle, this tall structure is at the edge of the peninsula overlooking the sea Lighthouse Ruins Reduced to a memorial stone History[edit] May 1, 1889 — the boundaries of the villages known as Tara, ?ura, and Nanaura were established. February 11, 1955 — Tara and ?ura became one town, Tara-ch?. March 1, 1955 — a section of Nanaura was absorbed into Tara-ch?. History[edit] Due to influence from Nagasaki, Christianity existed in the area, but after the results of the Shimabara Rebellion, most of the Christians were killed or went underground and became Kakure Kirishitans. The only evidence remaining is grave stones that are scattered throughout Tara. Legends[edit] Local legend has it that a force from the south once tried to invade Tara. The villagers wore demon masks to scare the intruders, and won the skirmish. Another local legend originating in the 9th century is that of a handsome warrior-monk, Takeno Shintaro, whose looks so charmed the ladies that they sang a song whenever he came down from the mountains. The lyrics of the song ask for him to fall and break his leg so that he would have to stay among the women. Women could not go into the mountains at that time in history because of the mountains' sacred nature. The mountains themselves were worshiped as the realm of gods (at this time the local belief was that gods were another step along a buddha's progression), and the temple at Mount Tara, Kinsen-ji, had authority over more than 70 shrines in Ky?sh?. However, under the Meiji restoration, the god-buddha connection became taboo and today Kinsen-ji lies in disrepair. During 1780, a song named "Zanza-bushi" spread through Japan. Saga people adapted the melody and used it to recreate the song "Takeno Shintaro-san". The first two stanzas: “ When Shintaro comes down, Let us light a thousand lanterns along the way. He's so handsome and charming! When Shintaro goes back, Let us make his way slippery with water. He's too handsome to be set free! ” There is a legend about the origins of the Doro Mochi Tsuki festival (see festivals section below). In the legend, set about 200 years ago, the village was poor. On occasion of the village elder being away on a pilgrimage, the town's people all had the same dream. In the mysterious dream, an itinerant monk came to the village as they were discussing how to pray for rain and in hunger stole some mochi. The villagers blamed him and killed him. Out of regret, they buried him. Rain fell upon the place where he was buried. The villagers believed the rain was due to the monk, and offered mochi to him, thus starting the traditional festival. Festivals and religious occasions[edit] There are many festivals in Tara, some with history spanning back hundreds of years. These are listed below, in order of date. January 2 - January 3, Takezaki Avalokitesvara revision meeting oni festival (??????????, takezaki kanzeon sh?seikai oni matsuri?): A hadaka matsuri at Takezaki Kanzeon temple wherein men dressed in loincloths try to stop a man dressed as an oni, who carries a box. The men then pull at the oni and shred the red kimono the oni wears. There is also a dance by boys in costumes. January 8, Archery of Och?zu (???????, och?zu no matoiri?): This matsuri is an archery event in the Ochiy?zu district in which the participants wield bows and arrows made out of green bamboo. Words like "east", "west", "south", "north" and "oni" are written on the targets. 33,333 arrows are said to be shot metaphorically, though the actual number is much less. 3 is a number that carries connotations of innocent omens in the festival, therefore the figure. Mid January, Straw mat festival (???, enza matsuri?): A children's festival at Takezaki Kanzeon temple in which they take round straw mats and pierce them with long spears. Then they take the luck of the new year upon themselves and make wishes. January 14, Whack-a-mole (?????, mogura uchi?): A children’s festival in which they go around carrying sticks with straw wrapped around the end. They chant, "Tonae gen (????)!", a ritual saying, as they strike the ground in unison. This drives away bad luck and invites fortune. This type of festival happens in other places in Japan. April 1, White fox dance (????, shirogitsune odori?): To honor their ancestors, people dress as white foxes and perform a synchronized dance. Mid May, Nagare Kanj? (?????): A Buddhist ceremony in Takezaki Kanzeon temple and around the coast that appeases the force in charge of the catch and prays for a safe fishing season. During the ceremony a monk travels along the coast, ringing gongs and beating drums, while chanting a sutra in honor of a bodhi ancestor that is interred at Takezaki Kanzeon temple. This ceremony is more than 400 years old. End of July, beginning of August Tara Cool Summer Festival (?????????, Tara-ch? N?ry? Natsu Matsuri?): At night the town gathers on Michikoshi beach and dances, O-bon-style, in a giant ring. Many people wear yukata. There are also fireworks. This is a relatively new festival, but arguably the biggest in Tara. Many events happen at the same time, and traditional matsuri stands are set up, allowing access to festival foods and games. 2nd Saturday and Sunday of September, Mount Tara Shrine Fall Festival (???????, Tara-dake Jinja Aki Matsuri?): At Tara-dake Shrine and throughout Tara for a few weeks, people give thanks for (and for ensuring for the prosperity of another) a big harvest. People excitedly dance around in black outfits and wear oni masks. They also carry drums and cymbals and beat taiko drums. This is said to be the oldest of Tara's festivals and traditions. September 22, Mud Mochi Making (????, Doro mochi tsuki?): A muddy, mochi-pounding festival at Itoki Kabuta, in which men wearing fundoshi battle each other on a slippery mud field of red-clay while pounding mochi (see above for origins of this matsuri). The muddy mochi made in the event is then offered on a plate to a statue of Yakushi Nyorai. Other Events[edit] January 4, New Year Marathon (????????, Shinshun marason taikai?): To celebrate the return of spring, runners from Tara and other places gather in front of Tara elementary school and run a marathon. July 10: Shirahama beach officially opens July 21: Camp Nakayama opens to the public. End of July through the beginning of August, All-Japan rhinoceros beetle sumo contest (???????????, Zen-nihon kabutomushi sum? taikai?). Held in Tagori, kids come from all over Japan to have their pet beetles fight in little rings on the tops of logs. The beetle that falls of the log loses. Discontinued Festivals and traditions[edit] Some festivals have recently stopped being performed, or are rarely observed anymore. Among them are: the cucumber festival, in which cucumbers were piled in hopes of blessings such as safety and babies, and the demon fires events, in which large bonfires were made. Industry[edit] Seaweed-gathering nets in the Ariake Sea Tara was once a thriving tourist destination, but as Japan's economy has slowed down, so has Tara's. Most young people relocate to the larger cities when they become adults. Tara is on a main railroad line and traversed by route 207 (see transportation below), and benefits somewhat from the tourism this brings. As a result, many people in Tara are opposed to new train lines that would make commerce through Tara all but obsolete. However planning has gone ahead, and Tara has received a payoff to compensate. It is regionally famous for its crabs (of the wanigani variety), mikans, and oysters, the latter of which is in season during the winter. During oyster (or kaki) season, it is common for people to come from surrounding prefectures and enjoy grilled kaki. Many restaurants have special, bare-bones plastic and wood sections that are only open during this season. Most of such business happens on the weekends, and this is also a good business time for the local farmer's market. Other industry in Tara includes animal husbandry, especially chicken farms, and forestry. But Tara's most profitable industry probably lies in the surrounding sea. Besides fishing and marine life, Tara boasts thousands of nori collecting poles and nets. Education[edit] Tara has one prefectural highschool, Tara High School (??????????), and two junior high schools. There are also two elementary schools and scattered kindergartens. Transportation[edit] Most travelers come to Tara by National Route 207 or via the Nagasaki Main Line, operated by JR Kyushu. Stations[edit] Tara is serviced by the JR Kyushu railroad company. It has two stations and one switchbox. Nagasaki Main Line Tara Station Hizen-?ura Station Air[edit] The closest airport is Saga Airport, followed by one in Nagasaki. Most travelers go to Fukuoka Airport for travel abroad. Roads[edit] National Route 207 runs through the length of the town, and is the only road to Nagasaki Prefecture. The mountains are seeded with small roads, many of them one lane and unpaved. A road leads from camp Nakayama towards Kashima and Ureshino. Sea[edit] While fishing is a huge industry, there is no known sea travel, nor are there ferries available. Language[edit] While standard Japanese is spoken and understood in the area, the locals also speak the local dialect, Saga-ben, which is further broken down into Tara-ben and ?ura-ben. Some examples of speech include: "d?gan", or the even older and more rustic "d?gyan"; approximately equivalent to standard Japanese's "d?" (how). Extremely common words that end in "re" have "re" replaced by "i". For instance, "kore" = "koi", "ore" = "oi" etc. "Kyu kyan ba" means "I have to eat it today" "Soigi ne" (in the Tara quarter) and "Aigi ne" (in ?ura) are the local equivalent to "ja ne", or in English "see you later". "Soigi" is generally substituted where standard Japanese's "ja" or "de wa" would be.

He was noted for his actions in the Union victory at Fort Pulaski, where his modern rifled artillery readily pounded the fort's exterior stone walls, an action that essentially rendered stone fortifications obsolete. He earned an international reputation as an organizer of siege operations and helped revolutionize the use of naval gunnery.

He was named after the president-elect at the time of his birth, John Quincy Adams. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1845. He graduated in 1849, first in a class of 43 members. He was appointed to the engineers and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1856. From 1849 until 1852, he was engaged in constructing the fortifications at Hampton Roads in coastal Virginia. For the next four years, he was instructor of Practical Military Engineering at West Point and designed a new riding school. Beginning in 1856, Gillmore served as a purchasing agent for the Army in New York City. He was promoted to captain in 1861. Civil War[edit] Engineering duty on the Atlantic Coast[edit] Gillmore at Charleston Harbor, 1863 With the outbreak of the Civil War in early 1861, Gilmore was assigned to the staff of Brig. Gen.Thomas W. Sherman and accompanied him to Port Royal, South Carolina. After being appointed as a brigadier general, Gillmore took charge of the siege operations against Fort Pulaski. A staunch advocate of the relatively new naval rifled guns, he was the first officer to effectively use them to knock out an enemy stone fortification. More than 5,000 artillery shells fell on Pulaski from a range of 1,700 yards during the short siege, which resulted in the fort's surrender after its walls were breached. The result of the efforts to breach a fort of such strength and at such a distance confers high honor on the engineering skill and self-reliant capacity of General Gilmore. Failure in an attempt made in opposition to the opinion of the ablest engineers in the army would have destroyed him. Success, which in this case is wholly attributable to his talent, energy, and independence, deserves a corresponding reward. —New York Tribune Although he was one of the best artillerists and engineers in the army he was not well respected by his men.[1] Service in Kentucky[edit] After an assignment in New York City, Gillmore traveled to Lexington, Kentucky, where he supervised the construction of Fort Clay on a hilltop commanding the city. Gillmore commanded a division in the Army of Kentucky then the District of Central Kentucky. Though long associated with engineering and artillery, Gillmore's first independent command came at the head of a cavalry expedition against Confederate General John Pegram. Gillmore defeated the Confederates at the battle of Somerset for which he was given a brevet (military) promotion to colonel in the U.S. Army. Return to the Department of the South[edit] Gillmore was assigned to replace Maj. Gen. Ormsby M. Mitchel in charge of the X Corps after that officer's death from yellow fever. In addition, Gillmore commanded the Department of the South, consisting of North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, with headquarters at Hilton Head, from June 12, 1863, to May 1, 1864. Under his direction, the army constructed two earthen forts in coastal South Carolina—Fort Mitchel and Fort Holbrook, located in the Spanish Wells area near Hilton Head Island. He then turned his attention against Charleston, South Carolina. Initially successful in an attack on the southern end of Morris Island on July 10, Gillmore had enough confidence to assault Fort Wagner on the north end of the island. The following day he launched the first attack on Fort Wagner which was defeated. He assembled a larger assault force and with the assistance of John A. Dahlgren's naval fleet planned a second attack. On July 18, 1863 Gillmore's troops were repulsed with heavy losses in the Second Battle of Fort Wagner. Gillmore's divisional commander, General Truman Seymour was wounded and two brigade commanders, George Crockett Strong and Haldimand S. Putnam were killed in the attack. The Gillmore Medal[edit] The Gillmore Medal is a military decoration of the United States Army which was first issued on October 28, 1863. The medal is named after Maj. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore who commanded Union troops attempting to seize Fort Wagner in 1863 during the American Civil War. Also called the Fort Sumter Medal, the Gillmore Medal commemorates the men who served in the fighting around Charleston, South Carolina, in 1863 and was presented to all Union soldiers who had served under General Gillmore's command. See link to medal below. Further information: Gillmore Medal Gillmore Orders His Command Integrated[edit] Among the troops who assaulted Ft. Wagner was the 54th Massachusetts, a regiment of African-Americans led (as required by regulation) by white commissioned officers. Gillmore had ordered that his forces be integrated and that African-Americans were not to be assigned menial tasks only, such as KP or latrine duty, but instead they were to carry arms into battle. They and their assault on Ft. Wagner were the subject of the 1989 Civil War movie Glory, which starred Morgan Freeman and Matthew Broderick. The Swamp Angel[edit] Gillmore decided on siege operations to capture Fort Wagner using innovative technology such as the Requa gun and calcium flood light to blind opponents during trenching efforts. He also implanted a massive Parrott rifle, nicknamed the "Swamp Angel," which fired 200-pound shots into the city of Charleston itself. Despite the swampy ground Union troops were able to work their way toward Fort Wagner. Meanwhile, Gillmore's artillery pounded Fort Sumter into rubble. On September 7 Gillmore's forces captured Fort Wagner.[2] In February 1864, Gillmore sent troops to Florida under the command of General Truman Seymour. Despite orders from Gillmore not to advance into the interior of the state, General Seymour advanced toward Tallahassee, the capitol, and fought the largest battle in Florida, the Battle of Olustee, which resulted in a Union defeat.[3] Virginia and Washington DC[edit] In early May, Gillmore and the X Corps were transferred to the Army of the James and shipped to Virginia. They took part in the Bermuda Hundred operations and played a principal role in the disastrous Drewry's Bluff action. Gillmore openly feuded with his superior, Benjamin F. Butler over the blame for the defeat. Gillmore asked for reassignment and left for Washington, D.C.. In July 1864, Gillmore helped organized new recruits and invalids into a 20,000-man force to help protect the city from a threat by 10,000 Confederates under Jubal A. Early, who had reached the outer defenses of the Union capital. Federal reinforcements from the Gulf coast were being transferred East at the time and Gillmore was put in command of a detachment of the XIX Corps which had been quickly diverted to the defense of the capital at the battle of Fort Stevens. Close of the War[edit] With the threat to Washington over the XIX Corps was transferred to the Army of the Shenandoah and Gillmore was reassigned to the Western Theater as inspector of military fortifications. As the war was drawing to an end he was reassigned to command of the Department of the South one final time and was in command when Charleston and Fort Sumter were finally turned over to Union forces. He received brevet promotions to Brigadier General and Major General in the U.S. Army for the campaign against Battery Wagner, Morris Island and Fort Sumter dated March 13, 1865. With the war over, he resigned from the volunteer army on December 5, 1865. Postbellum career[edit] Gillmore returned to New York City and became a well known civil engineer, authoring several books and articles on structural materials, including cement. He was involved in the reconstruction of fortifications along the Atlantic coast (including, ironically, some that he had destroyed as a Union general). He served on the Rapid Transit Commission that planned the elevated trains and mass public transportation, as well as leading efforts for harbor improvements and coastal defenses. He was a prominent member of the University Club of New York. His first wife died (date unknown for this post). He is reported to have married the widow of General Braxton Bragg, sometime after Bragg dropped dead in New Orleans in 1876. One of General Gillmore's sisters, Sophia, married a Civil War officer named Daniel Seth Leslie; Leslie was from the same area near Lorain, OH, as Gillmore. Three descendants of Daniel Seth Leslie were named in General Gillmore's honor, i.e. "Quincy Gillmore Leslie", his son "Quincy Charles Leslie" and his son, "Quincy Gilmore Leslie". In light of General Gillmore's association with African American troops under his command, Daniel Leslie was assigned some responsibilities for African American veterans after the Civil War. His name (Daniel Seth Leslie) is reported to appear on a monument to African American troops in the Washington, DC area. Some African Americans carried the Gillmore and Leslie names forward. The Traveling Secretary for the Negro Leagues Kansas City Monarchs was named Quincy "J." Jordan Gilmore. (note the change from two LL's in Gilmore). He was nicknamed "Sect" and held that position from 1920 to 1925, with the Monarchs winning the Negro League World Series in 1924. He was born in Gary, IN, on June 29, 1882, died Feb 2, 1952. A baseball card has been published in his honor, by "Phil Dixon, 1987". Also, there are at least two contemporary (1990s to 2007) African American's named Quincy Leslie, one of whom is a Sergeant in the US Air Force. General Gillmore died at Brooklyn, New York, at the age of 63. His son and grandson, both also named Quincy Gillmore, were also generals in the U.S. Army. In memoriam[edit] A coal schooner named in his honor, the General QA Gillmore, sank in 1881 in Lake Erie about 45 miles west of Lorain, near Kelley's Island. The shipwreck remains in the shallow waters of the lake. A second ship was launched bearing his name, called the "Q. A. Gillmore". It was a steam powered tugboat "Hull #24" built for the Great Lakes Towing Company of Cleveland, Ohio, and launched around 1912-13. She also sailed on the Great Lakes and participated in rescues of ships in the famous and infamous Great Lakes storm of 1913. She was later sold and renamed the Reiss, which was a line of Great Lakes ore and commodity carriers, but which went out of business in the 1970s or so; one such ship was the Richard Reiss. The tug Q. A. Gillmore, now named the Reiss, is still afloat, anchored and located off of Tower Marine in Saugatuk, Michigan, and about 100 yards from the retired cruise ship S.S. Keewatin. Saugatuk is on the shores of Lake Michigan. According to the owner of Tower Marine, R.J. Peterson of Saugatuk, as of the winter of 2007, her engines were still operational. The Reiss was owned by the Saugatuk Marine Museum and they donated the vessel to the Northeastern Maritime Historical Foundation of Duluth, Minnesota, sometime around May 2004. However, she is stuck in a mud bank out in the harbor and has not moved in recent years.

Multifunctionality in agriculture
Multifunctionality in agriculture (often simply multifunctionality) refers to the numerous benefits that agricultural policies may provide for a country or region. Generally speaking, multifunctionality refers to the non-trade benefits of agriculture, that is, benefits other than commerce and food production.[1] These include, in the WTO definition of multifunctionality, environmental protection, landscape preservation, rural employment, and food security.[2] These can be broadly classified as benefits to society, culture, a national economy as a whole, national security, and other concerns. For example, in addition to providing food and plant-derived products for the population, agriculture may also provide jobs for rural people and contribute to the viability of the area, create a more stable food supply, and provide other desired environmental and rural outputs.[3]

For example, in addition to providing food and plant-derived products for the population, agriculture may also provide jobs for rural people and contribute to the viability of the area, create a more stable food supply, and provide other desired environmental and rural outputs.[3] Contents 1 Multifunctionality and agricultural policies 2 WTO trade discussions 3 References 4 External links Multifunctionality and agricultural policies[edit] The numerous externalities, both positive and negative, which are associated with agriculture are important considerations for policy makers. Sometimes current agricultural practices and markets produce too much of an undesired effect or not enough of a desired one. Governments may step in to correct such market failures with policies designed to either encourage or discourage a certain practice. However, individual policies may carry consequences for other policies and for other countries. Such policies are therefore a major topic of discussion in the international community.[4] Removing protectionist policies on agriculture is one step that may need to be taken for a country to maximize positive externalities, minimize negative ones and make sure that the mixture of outputs derived from agriculture corresponds to the needs of society.[5] However, removing agricultural supports is often cause for consternation among public officials, who may predict the loss of certain positive externalities of the policies already in place. At the same time, officials may fear the implementation of new market protections in other countries which are trying to promote the production of such outputs of agriculture.[6] In such cases, advocates for free trade, such as OECD recommend that countries reduce as much as possible their agricultural protections and institute policies which specifically target the production of the positive non-commodity outputs.[7] To help countries formulate their agricultural policies, OECD has established a framework for analyzing non-commodity outputs of agricultural activities.[8] When analyzing the multifunctionality of agriculture and the appropriate policies to implement, there are several concepts that need to be considered. The first of these is jointness, or the extent to which the intended agricultural product and the incidental non-commodity outputs of agricultural activity are linked. The production of some non-commodity outputs may be inseparable from agricultural commodity outputs while others may be produced independently of agricultural activity. The goal is to separate agricultural commodities and non-commodity outputs as much as possible. The next issue to be addressed is whether or not the production or non-production of the non-commodity output in question constitutes a market failure. If there is no market failure, there is no need for a policy to correct it. Finally policy makers should examine the characteristics of the output in question since it may have both a degree of market failure and jointness associated with it. After considering the matter from these three perspectives, policy makers may find non-governmental ways of addressing dealing with non-commodity outputs or make changes in their agricultural policies.[9] WTO trade discussions[edit] In agricultural trade discussions in the WTO, the EU and Japan, among others, argue that multifunctionality justifies continued protection and subsidization of agriculture. The United States and the Cairns Group argue that support of multifunctionality should be specific, targeted, and provided in a non-trade distorting manner.[10] References[edit] ^ http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/multifunctionality_e.htm ^ http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/multifunctionality_e.htm ^ “Multifunctionality,” OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture, OECD.org, 20 July 2007 <http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_33779_1_1_1_1_1,00.html>. ^ “Multifunctionality: About,”OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture, OECD.org, 20 July 2007 <http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_33779_1_1_1_1_1,00.html>. ^ Multifunctionality: Towards an Analytical Framework, Paris: OECD Publications, 2001, SourceOECD, 20 July 2007 http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx (14). ^ Multifunctionality: The Policy Implications, Paris: OECD Publications, 2003, SourceOECD, 20 July 2007 <http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx>.(8) ^ Multifunctionality: Towards an Analytical Framework, Paris: OECD Publications, 2001, SourceOECD, 20 July 2007 http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx (14). ^ “Multifunctionality: About,”OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture, OECD.org, 20 July 2007 <http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_33779_1_1_1_1_1,00.html>. ^ Multifunctionality: The Policy Implications, Paris: OECD Publications, 2003, SourceOECD, 20 July 2007 <http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx> (9-11). ^ CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905 External links[edit] Multifuntionality: OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture WTO Glossary - Multifunctionality

Contents 1 Gameplay 2 Ports, clones, and sequels 3 Music 4 Reception and legacy 5 References 6 External links Gameplay[edit] Columns was one of the many Tetris-like puzzles to appear after its great success in the late 1980s.[1] The area of play is enclosed within a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen "columns". While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it. After a column lands, if three or more of the same symbols are connected in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this resettlement causes three or more other symbols to align, they too disappear and the cycle repeats. Occasionally, a special column with a multicolor Magic Jewel appears. It destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it. The columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with jewels, which ends the game.[citation needed] Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. "Flash columns" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. "Doubles" allows two players work together in the same well. "Time trial" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.[citation needed] Ports, clones, and sequels[edit] Columns was the first pack-in game for the Sega Game Gear. This version was slightly different from the Mega Drive version and its soundtrack was transposed and rearranged due to the limitations of the handheld's sound chip. While the columns themselves were updated for the Mega Drive version, the overall decoration was less like a cartoon in the Game Gear version and instead more artistically designed. Lastly, the Game Gear version had a feature that let the player change the jewels to fruit, squares, dice, or card shapes (clubs, diamonds, spades).[citation needed] Many sequels and spin-offs were produced: Columns II: The Voyage Through Time, Columns III: Revenge of Columns, Columns '97, Sakura Taisen: Hanagumi Taisen Columns 1 & 2, and many compilations and re-releases (Columns Arcade Collection, Sega Ages Vol. 07: Columns) as well. Because Columns was made by Sega, versions were made available on the Master System, Mega Drive, Mega-CD, Game Gear, Saturn, and Dreamcast. Additional versions of the game have also been made available on PC Engine, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation 2. The Game Boy Color version was specifically called Columns GB: Osamu Tezuka Characters, where it featured many of his characters such as Kimba and Astroboy, but also featured slightly less known characters such as Unico.[citation needed] On November 7, 2006, Columns was released as part of the game Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2, and later on another release of the above compilation for PlayStation Portable. On December 4, 2006 the title was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console for 800 Wii Points. It is also included on Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[2] Most recently the game was ported to iOS by Sega.[citation needed] Columns has also been cloned many times across different platforms: Title Platform Release date Developer Publisher Notes Coloris Amiga 1990 Signum Victoriae Avesoft Magic Jewelry NES 1990 Hwang Shinwei RCM Group The title is the best known of all his clones, and was released on unlicensed Famicom multicarts.

The song "Clotho" is named after the Greek Moira of the same name, related to the Greek flavor of some of the game's art. The other main songs are titled "Atropos"[3] and "Lathesis" (sic[4]), other "Moirai". Reception and legacy[edit] Reception Review score Publication Score MegaTech 88%[5] Reviewing the game's appearance in Sega Arcade Classics for the Sega CD, Glenn Rubenstein gave it a B+, describing it as "like Tetris but a bit better."[6] Mega placed the game at number 34 in their "Top Mega Drive Games of All Time".[7] References[edit] ^ "The Maturation of Computer Entertainment: Warming The Global Village".

(magazine),[12] and PC Magazine.[13] Criticism[edit] Commenting on HealthTap in early 2012, Peter W. Carmel, president of the American Medical Association, said the Internet should “complement, not replace, the communication between a patient and their physician.” With online health advice, the doctor doesn't take a history, doesn't do a physical exam, and doesn't monitor or assess any suggested treatment. "Using this information in isolation could pose a threat to patients,” he said.[14] In March 2015, HealthTap hired Dr. Jay Wohlgemuth, former Chief Scientific Officer and SVP of R&D and Medical at Quest Diagnostics as its new Chief Healthcare Officer.[15] In a recent Forbes article, Dr. Wohlgemuth stated his intention to spread the benefits of HealthTap's transparent doctor-patient meritocracy "without 'disrupting' the whole healthcare system as other digital-health companies claim to do...it’s a false dichotomy: Why put traditional medicine and digital health at odds with one another when they’re really so complementary? 'If you have patients who are seeking healthcare,' he explains, 'ultimately they’re going to plug into bricks and mortar.'".[16] References[edit] ^ Rebecca Jarvis, [1], Good Morning America, August 6, 2014 ^ http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/how-to-save-10000-lives-with-an-app-flatter-doctors/?_r=0 ^ Regina Sinsky, "HealthTap's Social Network of 5,000 Doctors Is Ready to Give Free Advice", The New York Times, September 26, 2011 ^ Tomio Geron "HealthTap Q&A Site Connects Doctors and Patients" Forbes, December 06, 2011 ^ Bonnie Rochman "A New Health Site in Beta Testing for Pregnant Women, New Moms" ^ <"10,000 Physicians Strong and Growing" bizjournals.com, February 12, 2012 ^ SF Chronicle, [2], "Startup RateRx creates tool that lets doctors review medications", March 12, 2015 ^ TechCrunch, [3], "HealthTap Launches RateRx, A Doctor Recommendation System For Drug Treatments", March 11, 2015 ^ CNBC, [4], "Can Amazon-like reviews work for prescriptions?", March 11, 2015 ^ Wired, [5], "Doctors on This Site Rate Drugs to Give Patients More Power", March 11, 2015 ^ Fast Company, [6], "Now You Can See What Actual Doctors Think About The Medication You Take", March 11, 2015 ^ Inc., [7], "The Startups Saving Health Care", February 2014 ^ PC Magazine, [8], "Know Your Telehealth Options: An Interview With HealthTap's Ron Gutman", January 5, 2015 ^ Advice for the Ill, and Points for the Doctors, By RANDALL STROSS, New York Times, February 4, 2012 ^ HealthTap Blog, [9], "HealthTap Names Dr. Jay Wohlgemuth Chief Healthcare Officer", March 19, 2015 ^ Forbes, [10], "Big Data Has Big Potential For HealthTap's New Healthcare Chief", March 19, 2015 External links[edit] HealthTap main page: https://www.healthtap.com/

Metro sign at Yingkoudao station Entrance to Xinanjiao station The Tianjin Metro is the current rapid transit system in the city of Tianjin, which was the second city (after Beijing) in China to operate a subway system. Opened in 1984, the system now has 5 operating lines and 95 stations spanning over a total of 132.4 km. The lines are jointly operated by two rapid transit companies, namely the Tianjin Metro Group Co. Ltd and the Binhai Mass Transit Development Co. Ltd. The former mainly operates lines in the downtown, while the latter operates lines that serve the Binhai New Area and TEDA.

After the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the number of vehicles on the roads significantly increased, causing pollution. To overcome these problems, the transport authority decided to close the old tram network and switch over to a rapid transit system. However, due to economic costs, it was not until 1970 that construction of the system first took place. The first section, spanning 3.6 km of track and 4 stations, namely Xinhualu, Yingkoudao, Anshandao and Haiguangsi stations, was completed by February 1976. The second section, with an additional 1.6 km of track and the Xinanjiao and Erweilu stations, was completed by 1980. After construction resumed, the total length was 7.4 km, with 8 stations, and service on the line began on December 28, 1984. To reduce construction costs, the transport authority decided to use an abandoned canal bed to form part of the system, and did not dig deeply. By using the canal bed, the underground section is only 2–3 meters under the street surface, and was the world's shallowest metro. There were only 1,000 full-time construction workers at that time; the others were volunteers from factories, schools and institutions all over the city. The average number of volunteer workers exceeded 2,000 a day, which rendered the project unique in the world then. Construction was delayed in 1976 when an earthquake hit the city, but was resumed in 1979 and completed by 1984. At the end of the 1990s, it was observed that the Metro system was quite out of date. The atmosphere of the stations was uninviting, difficult to navigate, and with few passenger amenities on the platforms. Trains were infrequent, sporadic and commonly delayed. The trains themselves were dilapidated, seat covers often torn off, and dim. Taking into consideration more modern, cleaner systems in East Asia, a massive reconstruction, modernization and expansion plan was laid out in 2000. In preparation, the system was closed on 1 September 2001, with renovation fully starting on 21 November. After purchasing new rolling stock, adding half-height platform screen doors and extending the line up to Shuanglin, the line re-opened on 6 December 2006 as Line 1, after trial testing that began on 12 June of that year. During the renovation of the first line, other lines underwent construction. Line 9, operated by Binhai Mass Transit Development Co. Ltd, began construction in 2001 and its first section opened on 28 March 2004. Between 2004 and 2007, many new stations on the line opened successively. On 1 May 2011, the line was further extended westwards by 3 stations, bringing it to its current length of 52.8 km. The Tram line in the system, the TEDA Modern Guided Rail Tram, was built to serve the Tianjin Economic Development Area and was opened on 10 May 2007. Line 2, after a lengthy construction delay and a structural accident, finally opened, as two separate sections, to the public on 1 July 2012, with the sections being reconnected on 28 August 2013. Line 3, another main north-south line, opened in October 2012.

Due to a structural accident in Jianguodao Station, Line 2 was operated as two separate sections from July 2012 to 28 August 2013, when the affected station opened after being rebuilt. The line is 22.7 km long with 19 stations. Line 3[edit] Main article: Line 3, Tianjin Metro The line, running southeast-northwest, opened on 1 October 2012. It is 22.3 km long with 21 stations. 20 km of track is underground, with 1.2 km at ground level and the rest on elevated viaducts. Of the 21 stations, one is elevated, one is at ground level and the other 19 are underground. Line 6[edit] Main article: Line 6, Tianjin Metro Line 6 will run from Xinwaihuandonglu to Xianshuigu. The full line is under construction and will be 50.1 km long with 38 stations. The first part of this line (only 8 stations from Changhong Gongyuan to Nancuiping) was opened in August 2016. There will be a total of 21 stations. This line will be built on the 5th line of tie-line to form a loop. Line 9[edit] Main article: Line 9, Tianjin Metro Line 9 is an east-west line running just north of the Haihe River. It was opened in 2004, spanning 52.8 km with 19 stations. The line is operated by Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Co. Ltd and provides interchange to the TEDA Tram line. Line 9 was suspended after damage from the August 2015 explosions, and resumed operation on December 16 from Tianjin Railway Station to Tianjin Pipe Corporation Station.[3] TEDA Modern Guided Rail Tram[edit] Main article: TEDA Modern Guided Rail Tram The TEDA Tram is a tram line that runs between TEDA and North of College District stations, mainly serving the Tianjin Economic Development Area (TEDA). It opened on May 10, 2007 and is 7.86 km long. Rolling stock[edit] There were older, box-type metro cars, built by Nippon Sharyo until the system was closed for reconstruction. After re-opening, 114 CNR Changchun Railway Vehicle Company Limited Rapid Train set Vehicle cars entered service & replaced the old ones. Unlike the old cars, the CNR cars contain air conditioning. Fares[edit] Tianjin Metro uses magnetic smartcards. The fare is distance-based and ranges between 2 and 5 Yuan.

FC Nürnberg on loan from FC Augsburg from the Bundesliga.[2] Contents 1 Mainz 05 2 FC Augsburg 3 International career 4 Personal life 5 References Mainz 05[edit] He made his Bundesliga debut on 27 October 2012 as a late substitute against Hoffenheim. Parker scored four goals in 27 league appearances for Mainz.[3] FC Augsburg[edit] On 1 July 2014, Parker transferred to Bundesliga club FC Augsburg and signed a four-year deal. [4] International career[edit] Parker has appeared for Germany at the under-15, under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19, under-20, and under-21 levels but still remains eligible for the United States due to having an American father. In 2012, it was revealed that United States manager Jürgen Klinsmann had spoken to Parker about representing the United States in the future. Speaking on his international preference, Parker said, "It is a hard decision to make of course. One should be very proud to play for the country your father is from. I am playing for Germany now and this is my home base. Both sides are very interesting. I like Germany now, but I won’t rule out that I will play for the United States in the future." [5] Personal life[edit] Parker was born in Wiesbaden to an American serviceman father who settled in Germany after serving in the military and a German mother. Parker briefly lived in Virginia before moving back to Germany. He has two younger brothers, Devante and Jermaine, who are part of the Mainz youth teams.

Middle Eastern cuisine
Middle Eastern cuisine is the cuisine of the various countries and peoples of the Middle East. The cuisine of the region is diverse while having a degree of homogeneity. It includes Arab cuisine, Persian cuisine, Israeli cuisine, Kurdish cuisine, Armenian cuisine, Georgian cuisine, Azerbaijani cuisine and Turkish cuisine[1] Some commonly used ingredients include olives and olive oil, pitas, honey, sesame seeds, dates,[1] sumac, chickpeas, mint and parsley. Some popular dishes include Kebabs, Dolma, and Doner Kebab (similar to Shawarma).

It is common in Azerbaijan and Iran. It is very similar to Arab Shawarma. The Middle East includes the region formerly known as the Fertile Crescent (the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers), where wheat was first cultivated, followed by barley, pistachios, figs, pomegranates, dates and other regional staples. Fermentation was also discovered here to leaven bread and make beer. As a crossroads between Europe, Asia and Africa, this area has long been a hub of food and recipe exchange. During the Persian Empire (ca. 550–330 BCE), the foundation was laid for modern Middle-Eastern food when rice, poultry and various fruits were incorporated into the local diets. Figs, dates and nuts were brought by Arabian warriors to conquered lands, and spices were brought back from the Orient.[2] The area was also influenced by dumplings from Mongol invaders; turmeric, cumin, garlic and other spices from India; cloves, peppercorns and allspice from the Spice Islands; okra from Africa; and tomatoes from the New World, via the Moors of Spain. Religion has also influenced the cuisine; neither Jews nor Muslims eat pork, making lamb the primary meat. Since the Qur'an forbids alcohol consumption, the region isn't noted much for its wine—except in religiously mixed Lebanon, where vineyards like Chateau Ksara, Chateau Kefraya and Chateau Masaya have gained international fame for their wines. Chateau Ksara is also very popular for its arak, the Lebanese version of raki and ouzo. Al-Maza is Lebanon's primary brewery, which was also, at one time, the Middle East's only beer-producing factory. Lebanon has always been well known in the region for its wines and arak, making it an exception when it comes to lack of alcohol in the region.[1][3] Under the Ottoman Empire, sweet pastries of paper thin phyllo dough and dense coffee were brought to the area. Elements[edit] Jerusalem mixed grill Cereals[edit] Cereals constitute the basis of the Middle Eastern diet, both historically and today. Wheat and rice are the major and preferred sources of staple foods. Barley is also widely used in the region and maize has become common in some areas as well. Bread is a universal staple —eaten in one form or another by all classes and groups— practically at every meal. Aside from bread, wheat is also used in the forms of burghul and couscous. Burghul is cracked wheat, made by partially cooking the wheat grains in water, drying it in an oven or in the sun, then breaking it into pieces, in different grades of size. Typically, it is cooked in water, with flavorings, much like rice. Burghul is also used in making meat pies and as an ingredient in salads, notably in tabbouleh, with chopped parsley, tomato, lemon, and oil. Freekeh is another common grain, made from immature green wheat. There are many types of rice produced and consumed in the region. Plain rice is served under grilled meats or with meat/vegetable stews. In more complex rice dishes, there are layers of meat, vegetables, sauces, nuts, or dried fruits. Flavorings[edit] Butter and clarified butter (also known as smen) are, traditionally, the preferred medium of cooking. Olive oil is prevalent in the Mediterranean coastal areas. Christians use it during Lent, when meat and dairy products are excluded, and Jews use it in place of animal fats such as butter to avoid mixing meat and dairy products. Most regions in the Middle East use spices. Typically, a stew will include a small amount of cinnamon, cloves, cumin, and coriander. Black pepper is common, and chili peppers are used occasionally, especially as a separate sauce or as a pickle. Parsley and mint are commonly used both in cooking and in salads. Thyme and thyme blends (za'atar) are common in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and Palestine, and a mixture of dried thyme and sumac (crushed sour berries) is a common breakfast item with oil and bread. Sumac is also sprinkled over grilled meat. Garlic is common to many dishes and salads. Meat[edit] Kebab koobideh Lamb and mutton have always been the favored meats of the Middle East. Pork is prohibited in both Islam and Judaism, and as such is rarely eaten in the region. Prominent among the meat preparations are grilled meats, or kebabs. There are a wide variety of these grills, with many regional specialties and styles. The most common are the cubed cuts on skewers, known as shish kebab in most places. Chicken may also be grilled in the same fashion. Another common variety is kofta kebab, made from ground meat, sometimes mixed with onions and spices, shaped around the skewer like a long sausage and grilled. Kebabs are typically a street or restaurant food, served with bread, salad, and pickles. It is not usually prepared in domestic kitchens. Meat and vegetable stews, served with rice, bulgur, or bread, are another form of meat preparation in the region. Kibbeh is a pie or dumpling made with meat and cereal. The most common are made with ground meat (typically lamb) and burghul, worked together like a dough, then stuffed with minced meat that has been fried with onion, aromatics, and, sometimes, pine nuts or almonds and raisins. This can either be in the form of individual small dumplings (usually shaped like a torpedo), or in slices like a cake, baked on an oven tray with the stuffing placed between two layers of the dough. One variation is kibbeh naye, raw kibbeh, which is made by pounding raw meat and burghul together with seasoning and served with dips of lemon juice and chili sauce. Vegetables[edit] Tursu are the pickled vegetables of the cuisines of many Balkan and Middle East countries. Vegetables and pulses are the predominant staple of the great majority of the people in the Middle East. They are boiled, stewed, grilled, stuffed, and cooked with meat and with rice. Among the green leaf vegetables, many varieties of cabbage, spinach, and chard are widely used. Root and bulb vegetables, such as onions and garlic, as well as carrots, turnips, and beets are equally common. Squash, tomato, eggplants, and okra are distinctive elements in the cookery of the region. (Use your own discretion with this commentary, as Squash and tomatoes originate from the Americas, and are not 'distinctive' to the region as the above suggested.) Eggplant is often fried in slices and dressed in yogurt and garlic, or roasted over an open fire, then pulped and dressed with tahini (sesame paste), lemon juice, garlic, and cumin, a dish known as baba ghanoush. Tomato is the most ubiquitous ingredient in Middle Eastern cookery. It is used fresh in a variety of salads, cooked in almost every stew and broth, and grilled with kebab. Beans and pulses are crucial to the diet of the region, second only to cereals. Fava beans are eaten both green and dried. Dried, they are boiled into one of the most popular Egyptian foods- ful medames, a domestic and street food, eaten for breakfast or any other meal, mashed and dressed in oil, lemon, and chili. Similar dishes are found in all other parts of the region. The famous Falafel, now popular in Europe and America, was originally made from dried fava, crushed and formed into a rissole with herbs and spices, then fried. It is also made from chickpeas or a mixture of the two. Green fava are cooked like other green beans, boiled and dressed in oil, or stewed with meat. The haricot beans and black-eyed beans are also common. Lentils, split peas, and chickpeas are widely used in soups, with rice, in salads, or with meat. Hummus, made from chickpeas and sesame paste, originated in Syria and Lebanon. Dishes[edit] Meze is a selection of small dishes served to accompany alcoholic drinks as a course or as appetizers before the main dish in Arab countries, Turkic countries, and Iran. Stuffed vegetables are a dish most associated with the Middle East in the popular mind. They are commonly called dolma, the Turkish word meaning "stuffed," but also the Arabic mahshi. Grape leaves, chard, and cabbage are stuffed with rice, ground meat, pine nuts, and spices, and then stewed in oil and tomato. Many vegetables are similarly stuffed and stewed or baked, such as squash, onion, tomato, eggplant, peppers, and even carrots. Mezze is common throughout the Middle East. It consists of a number of small dishes that are picked at leisure: cheese, melon, nuts, various salads and dips, such as tabbouleh, hummus and mutabbal, pickles, and also more substantial items, such as grilled meat, kibbeh, and sausage.[4] Arabs commonly consume milk, fresh or soured. Yogurt, a Turkish contribution, is commonly consumed plain, used in cooking, used in salad dressing, or diluted as a drink. White cheeses, like the Greek feta and haloumi, are the most common in the region. Beverages[edit] Turkish coffee Turkish coffee is the most well known beverage of the region. It is thicker than regular coffee and is made by boiling finely ground coffee in water and then letting the grounds settle. In the 1980s, instant coffee also became popular. Aside from coffee, there is also an alcoholic drink called arak. It is most famous for its potency and milky-white color when water is added, producing the drink nicknamed "the milk of lions". Water and ice are almost always added because of an alcohol content between 30% and 60%. Arak is colorless in its pure form and is aniseed-flavored. In the Middle East, arak is served in social settings and with mezze.[5] A common drink served during Ramadan is Qamar El Deen, a thick and sweet apricot drink. The apricots are boiled with sugar and water until they are thick and placed on wooden planks left in the sun until dry. A fruit leather is left, which is then melted with water and sugar and drunk.[6] Another popular drink is Jallab. It is made by diluting a mixture grape molasses, dates, and rose water and served with crushed ice. Some also serve it with raisins or pine nuts.[7] Ayran (and Doogh) is a beverage made from yogurt very popular in certain Middle Eastern countries such as Turkey and Iran. Etiquette[edit] See also: Etiquette in the Middle East Dining etiquette in Arab countries[edit] In Arab countries of the Middle East, especially in the Arab states of Persian Gulf, it is common for people to take their food from a communal plate in the center of the table. Rather than employing forks or spoons, people traditionally dine without utensils; they scoop up food with their thumb and two fingers or pita bread. In the Arab culture, the left hand is considered unclean. Even left-handed people eat only with the right hand. A common exception is that the left hand may be used to hold a drinking glass when eating greasy food with the right.[8] It is proper etiquette to compliment the host on the food and his hospitality. Similarly, it is important to try every plate on the table. If a guest does not leave food on his plate, the host generally fills it immediately.[9] The Middle East places emphasis on enjoying meals with family and friends. Dining etiquette in non-Arab countries of Middle East[edit] Iran[edit] Dining etiquette for the home. If you are invited to an Iranian's house: Check to see if the host is wearing shoes. If not, remove yours at the door. Arrive at the invited time. Show respect for the elders by greeting them first. Expect to be shown into the guests' room. It is usually lavishly furnished with Persian styled furniture and Persian rugs. Shake everyone's hand individually. If you move from room to room, make sure to always allow the senior members of your party to enter the room ahead of you. The host sits at the head of the table, with the honored guest seated next to the host. In addition, the honored guest sits on the side of the table farthest from the door. The honored guest is served first, then the oldest man, then the rest. Accept any offer of food or drink. Remember to do 'taarof'. Wait to be told where to sit. Dining is done with forks and spoons and knives. Do not eat with hands. Try a bit if everything that is served. Meals are generally served family-style. Most tables are set with a spoon and fork only. There is often more food than you can eat. Part of Iranian hospitality is to shower guests with abundance. Expect to be offered second and even third helpings. Initial refusals will be assumed to be polite gestures (taarof again!) and are not taken seriously. Restaurants generally have two sections - "family" where women and families dine and "men only". Tips of between 10 and 15% are appreciated. As a guest, you will be invited to start eating first. Always comment on the food if at someone's home - the term 'daste shoma dard nakone'[literally 'may your hand not hurt'] is used to thank someone for doing something for you. It is customary to say "Nush-e Jan" ("Bon appetite!") before or after eating. In Iranian Azerbaijan the term "eliz a??rmas?n" [literally 'may your hand not hurt'] is used to thank someone. The language spoken in Iranian Azerbaijan is Azeri Turkish, a Turkic language. Turkey[edit] Tea is usually served in little curved glasses that you hold not by the stem, but by the lip: you never add milk, but you can add water as you drink it to dilute the tea, which is sometimes still steeping when you get it. Coffee is generally available. The coffee is drunk carefully (there are grounds on the bottom); it is also thick and black, and each cup is individually brewed, often with the sugar already in it, and milk is usually not to be added. Since it is offered all the time and everywhere, it is a gesture of hospitality and you must always take the coffee or tea, even if you only put it to your lips or just take a few sips. Your cup will always be refilled if it is less than half full. Because you must never pour your own drink, you must always be alert throughout the meal as to whether your neighbor's cup or glass needs refilling. If it is less than half full, it needs refilling; alternately, if yours is less than half full, your neighbor is obliged to refill it. If he or she does not, do not refill it yourself, for this will cause him or her to lose face; instead, diplomatically indicate your need by pouring a little more drink into your neighbor's glass, even if it doesn't really need it. If you are the honored guest, you will be expected to make a toast, usually soon after the host does or at the end of the meal, just before everyone departs. Dining is done with forks and spoons and knives, Western style. The knife is held in the right hand, and the fork in the left. Do not switch hands for knives and forks. Smoking is ubiquitous in Turkey. People smoke between courses during dinner. The host sits at the head of the table, with the honored guest seated next to the host. In addition, the honored guest sits on the side of the table farthest from the door. (At business meetings, the key people sit in the middle, flanked on either side in descending order by their aides, with the least important people sitting at the ends of the table farthest from the middle, and closest to the door; the arrangement is mirrored on the other side.) Men and women eating at someone's home might dine in separate areas (and spend the entire evening separated) or at separate times, with the men dining first The honored guest is served first, then the oldest man, then the rest of the men, then children, and finally women. Do not begin to eat or drink until the oldest man at the table has been served and has begun. You may want to ask your host when it is appropriate to begin. At the end of the meal, it is appropriate to thank the host or hostess for a wonderful meal. In restaurants, you often order each dish as you want it, so that they are not ordered all at once at the beginning of the meal. In informal restaurants, you may be required to share a table. If so, do not force conversation: act as if you are seated at a private table. Waitstaff may be summoned by making eye contact; waving or calling their names is very impolite. Dining etiquette for business meals. Most business meals are lunches. Business meals are generally not good times to discuss business or make business decisions; they are intended to build the more important personal relationship. Take your cue from your Turkish associates: if they bring up business, then it's okay to discuss it, but wait to take your lead from their conversation. Water, and other drinks, may not be served until after the meal is over, as some believe that drinking while eating is not healthy. When you are at a colleague's home for a formal meal, you will be invited to sit anywhere you like at the table; resist the impulse to sit down, and wait until your host gives you further instructions. These will generally come after the host or oldest man is seated, and often you will be placed at his side. It is a great honor to be invited into a Turkish home. Once inside, you may need to remove your shoes (this is not the custom in restaurants, however). If you move from room to room in a Turkish home, be sure to always allow the more senior members of your party to enter the room ahead of you. It is customary to say "Afiyet olsun" ("May what you eat bring well-being") before or after eating, and to say "Elinize sa?lik" (it is a compliment to the hostess, meaning "Bless your hand") after the meal. Month of Ramadan[edit] During the month of Ramadan, food consumption increases dramatically throughout Muslim communities. Breaking the fast becomes a banquet, with exchanges of invitations between kin and friends, and public banquets held by charities and associations. Cafes and pastry shops are open at night, and a carnival atmosphere prevails in the streets. Many Muslims, following the reported example of Muhammad, break their fast with a date, followed by a variety of dishes. Sweet pastries and puddings are always present on Ramadan nights everywhere. The end of Ramadan is marked by a festival, Id 'al-Fitr, a feast that breaks the fast, during which a great quantity and variety of sweets and pastries are consumed. The other major Muslim feast is that of 'Id al-Adha, the feast of the sacrifice, which occurs during the pilgrimage month. At this time an animal, usually a sheep or a goat, is slaughtered in every household that can afford it, and great banquets are prepared, with an obligation to give food to the poor.[4] Globalization[edit] In North America, Middle Eastern food first came became popular in the 1990s[citation needed] with the so-called Mediterranean diet. According to the Mayo Clinic, the benefits included reduced risks of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease and cancer.[citation needed] Geographical varieties of Arab cuisine of Middle East[edit] Bahraini cuisine Emirati cuisine Iraqi cuisine Jordanian cuisine Kuwaiti cuisine Lebanese cuisine Omani cuisine Palestinian cuisine Qatari cuisine Saudi Arabian cuisine Syrian cuisine Yemeni cuisine Geographical varieties of non-Arab cuisines of Middle East[edit] Assyrian cuisine Azerbaijani cuisine Armenian cuisine Cypriot cuisine Georgian cuisine Kurdish cuisine Iranian cuisine (Persian cuisine) Israeli cuisine (Jewish cuisine) Turkish cuisine See also[edit] Middle East portal Food portal Arab cuisine Caucasian cuisine Central Asian cuisine Greek cuisine Levantine cuisine Mediterranean cuisine Cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews Ottoman cuisine Islamic dietary laws Jewish dietary laws References[edit] Wikivoyage has travel information for Middle Eastern cuisine. ^ a b c "The Middle East: Background.", Globalgourmet.com.

In a career spanning 21 years, he scored 12,367 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 34.16. Contents 1 Biography 2 Notes 3 References 4 Bibliography Biography[edit] Born in Hyderabad, British India, Baig made his first-class during the 1954–55 Ranji Trophy, against Andhra Pradesh.[1] In his next match against Mysore, he scored 105 and 43 not out.[2] At the end of the tournament, he ended up as his team's second-highest run scorer, scoring 187 runs at an average of 62.33.[3] In the late 1950s, Baig moved to England and joined the Oxford University. In 1959, he played 15 first-class matches for the university team. During this time, he scored 221 not out and 87 against Free Foresters and broke Derrick De Saram’s aggregate of 283 runs—208 and 75—to become the highest run scorer for the team in a first-class match.[a] It was during this time India toured England. In the fourth match of the series, Baig was "summoned" to play for India, replacing the injured Vijay Manjrekar.[5] Aged 20 years and 131 days, Baig became the youngest Indian cricketer to score a century on debut when he made 112 in India's second innings. It was also the first century by an Indian debutant outside India.[6] Despite another century from Polly Umrigar, India lost the match.[5] However, Baig retained his place in the team for the final match of the series. Following the series in England, Baig was included in the Indian squad for the home series against Australia later that year. In the second Test at Kanpur, he scored 19 and 36 runs in both the innings. The match marked India's first Test victory against Australia.[7] In the first innings of the next match at Bombay, he scored 50 and was involved in a crucial 133-run partnership with Nari Contractor. Baig followed that with another half-century in the second innings when he made 58. His half-centuries were helped India secure a draw.[8] During a break in India's second innings, when Baig walked to the pavilion along with Ramnath Kenny, he was kissed on his cheek by a young woman spectator.[5] During the event, Baig became the first Indian cricketer to be kissed on the field.[9] Vijay Merchant who was commentating then remarked "I wonder where all these enterprising young ladies were when I was scoring my hundreds and two hundreds."[10] A painting called "The Kissing of Abbas Ali Baig", depicting the incident was featured in Salman Rushdie’s novel The Moor's Last Sigh (1995).[11] Baig's success in the 1959/60 season led to him being named as one of Indian Cricket 's five "Cricketers of the Year".[12] In the following season, Baig had an unsuccessful outing against Pakistan, managing to score just 34 runs in four innings. This led to him being dropped from the side for the subsequent series'. During this time, it was said he received a hate mail for under performing against fellow Muslims.[13] However, he was impressive in the domestic circuit, scoring heavily in the Ranji and Duleep Trophy tournaments. In 1966, he was included in the team for the home series against West Indies. Baig scored 48 runs in two of the Tests he played in the series. He was dropped again and never played Test cricket. He almost made it to the squad for the 1971 tour of West Indies before being dropped. Following that, he was selected to be a part of the Indian team that toured England in 1971. However, he was not included in the playing eleven for any of the Tests; Ashok Mankad was preferred to Baig.[6] Baig's three younger brothers—Murtuza Baig, Mazhar Baig, and Mujtaba Baig—all played professional cricket. Murtuza played first-class cricket for Hyderabad but was less successful than Abbas.[14] Notes[edit] ^ As of August 2015, this remains the second-highest total by an Oxford batsman; Sam Agarwal broke (313 runs) Baig's record in 2013.[4] References[edit] ^ "Hyderabad v Andhra".

Smith was born in Dwight, Illinois, in Livingston County He served as a United States Congressman from 1919 to 1921.

Frank L. Smith Frank Leslie Smith (November 24, 1867 – August 20, 1950) was an Illinois politician. Smith was born in Dwight, Illinois, in Livingston County He served as a United States Congressman from 1919 to 1921. He was elected by the people of Illinois to the United States Senate in 1926, but the Senate never allowed him to take his seat. He first ran for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1920. In that first year of suffrage, women's votes were counted separately from men's. He was beating William B. McKinley by 27,000 votes after the male votes were counted, but once the female votes were counted McKinley had won by 11,000 votes. McKinley went on to win the general election. In 1921, Smith became the chairman of the Illinois Commerce Commission, which oversaw utilities in the state. He prepared to run again for the Senate in 1926. At the time, Illinois had no campaign finance laws. Smith collected donations from several wealthy executives who ran public utilities, including $125,000 from Samuel Insull. He used this money to defeat McKinley in the Republican primary held in the summer of 1926. Smith went on to win the general election held in November of that year, although Julius Rosenwald offered him $550,000 of Sears, Roebuck & Company stock to withdraw.[citation needed] McKinley, whose lame duck term would normally extend until March 1927, died in December 1926. The governor appointed Smith to fulfill the rest of McKinley's term. When Smith went to present his credentials as the appointed Senator, the U.S. Senate voted to not allow him to qualify as a senator, based upon fraud and corruption in his campaign. He tried to again qualify as the elected Senator in March 1927, but was again denied. He finally resigned his seat on February 9, 1928. See also[edit] Frank L. Smith Bank References[edit] "Frank L.

Children's Past Lives
Children's Past Lives: How Past Life Memories Affect Your Child is a 1997 book by Carol Bowman. It is a non-academic book that was the first to explore the putative phenomenon of children’s spontaneous past life memories.[1]
Children's Past Lives Author Carol Bowman Language English Subject Reincarnation, Paranormal Genre Non-fiction Publisher Bantam Publication date 1997 Pages 368 ISBN 978-0-553-57485-2 OCLC 39668467 Followed by Return From Heaven Children's Past Lives: How Past Life Memories Affect Your Child is a 1997 book by Carol Bowman. It is a non-academic book that was the first to explore the putative phenomenon of children’s spontaneous past life memories.[1] In the book, Bowman suggests that many children will speak spontaneously (without hypnosis) of their past lives, but not all unusual statements or stories from children are past life memories. Most of the time, children are imitating storybooks, TV or movies. But sometimes a child may talk about a genuine past life.[2] Bowman says there are four ways to tell when a child may be talking about a previous life: look for a matter-of-fact tone, consistency over time, knowledge beyond experience, as well as corresponding behavior and traits.[3] The book received a positive review from Publishers Weekly and was recommended to readers of the new age community.[4] However, philosopher and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll heavily criticized the book and described it as a "firsthand testimony to ignorance of science, to gullibility and, above all, to wishful thinking."[5] Carol Bowman's second book, Return from Heaven, published in 2001, focuses specifically on children who appear to have reincarnated in their own previous family or extended family.

(February 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Randolph Fields (29 December 1952 in Santa Monica, California – 24 February 1997 in Jersey, Channel Islands) was an Anglo-American lawyer who founded British Atlantic Airways which later became Virgin Atlantic Airways. After differences with Richard Branson, Fields sold his share of Virgin Atlantic in 1985, becoming a sterling millionaire. He subsequently invested much of his fortune in the short-lived Highland Express Airways. Renowned in insurance circles as an expert on asbestos and environmental hazards coverage, his work involved weekly trans-Atlantic commuting where he took full advantage of lifetime complimentary upper class travel on Virgin Atlantic, long after being bought out. Fields was also a well-known poker player on both sides of the Atlantic. Principally known as a "cash" player, Fields won a European Poker Title and was a fixture at the major poker tournaments in Las Vegas, including the WSOP. Fields was an early financial backer of Phil Hellmuth. In The Independent David Spanier wrote this assessment : "Randolph Fields lit up any poker game he played in. Some players thought he was good value because he threw his chips into the pot with such abandon. Others recognised that beneath this swashbuckling play, Randolph had a pretty sharp mind for cards. I often saw him demolish the table by his aggressive betting in tournaments. Above all he brought a boyish enthusiasm to the game, a zest for a good gamble, which is quite rare these days." Fields had an identical twin brother Robbie Fields, owner of Posh Boy Records. Fields' older brother is well known London-based fashion mogul Gifi Fields. This article about aviation is a stub.

Takkanot Shum
The Takkanot Shum (Hebrew: ????? ??"???), or Enactments of SHU"M were a set of decrees formulated and agreed upon over a period of decades by the leaders of three of the central cities of Medieval Rhineland Jewry: Speyer, Worms, and Mainz. The initials of the Hebrew names for these cities, Shpira, Vermayza, and Magentza form the initials SHUM. While these regulations were intended to address the problems of that time, they had an effect on European Jewry that lasted centuries.[1]
The German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, in which the three SHU"M-cities are located today. The Takkanot Shum (Hebrew: ????? ??"???), or Enactments of SHU"M were a set of decrees formulated and agreed upon over a period of decades by the leaders of three of the central cities of Medieval Rhineland Jewry: Speyer, Worms, and Mainz. The initials of the Hebrew names for these cities, Shpira, Vermayza, and Magentza form the initials SHUM. While these regulations were intended to address the problems of that time, they had an effect on European Jewry that lasted centuries.[1] Contents 1 Background 2 Synod of the Takkanot 3 Synods of SHUM 4 Modern adherence 4.1 Dowry takkana 4.2 Chalitzah takkana 5 See also 6 References Background[edit] Following the devastation of much of the Jewish communities of the Rhineland during the First Crusade, Jews who had formerly made their livings as itinerant merchants could no longer travel safely, and had to find careers in the cities which they lived. Many became local merchants; others became moneylenders. This drastically increased the rate of commerce between Jews and non-Jews, and, thus, litigation both internally amongst Jews and between Jews and Non-Jews. Simultaneously, heavy taxes were being levied on the Jewish communities by the local government, taxes which many Jews at the time felt were being unfairly distributed by the leaders of the local kehilla. The increasing internal and external pressures on the Jewish community, together with their recent near destruction during the Crusades, caused the leaders of the time to take the step of instituting broad decrees to strengthen their communities.[2][3] Synod of the Takkanot[edit] In or around 1160, a synod was held in Troyes. This synod was led by Rabbeinu Tam, his brother, the Rashbam, both grandchildren of Rashi, and Eliezer ben Nathan (the Ra'avan). Over 250 rabbis from communities all over France attended as well. A number of communal decrees were enacted at the synod covering both Jewish-Gentile relations as well as matters relating internally to the Jewish community.[4] Examples of such decrees include: The restriction requiring Jews engaged in monetary disputes amongst themselves to have the case decided by a Jewish beth din, and not a secular court, unless one of the parties was refusing to accept the ruling rendered by the beth din. A person disputing the kehillah’s tax assessment on him should pay the tax first and then bring the assessors to beth din. A person lending space to a community to act as a synagogue cannot restrict specific individuals from praying there. He can only rescind the permission in toto.[5] Among the many new decrees implemented or older decrees strengthened was the famous ban of Rabbenu Gershom against polygamy.[6] Synods of SHUM[edit] Historical interior of the Rashi shul in Worms The synod in Troyes was binding only on French Jewry. In or around 1196, the rabbis and community leaders throughout the entire Rhineland called a synod of their own in Mainz, in which they affirmed most of the decrees of the Troyes synod, and added a number of their own. The decrees did not take as firm hold as was desired, so twenty-four years later, in 1220, a second synod was convened in Mainz, in which the leaders of the generation re-affirmed the decrees enacted in the first synod.[4][6] Important historical figures attending one or both of these synods included David of Münzenberg, Simha of Speyer, Jacob ben Asher of Speyer, Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi, and Elazar Rokeach.[7] These enactments covered both internal issues within the Jewish community as well as issues that involved interactions with the non-Jewish government of the time. Specific examples of enactments instituted or strengthened at the Rhineland synods include: The placement of a cherem on anyone who informed on another Jew until such time as restitution was made. The removal of all exceptions to community-imposed taxes. The prohibition against lending money to other Jews without ensuring strict adherence to the halakhot that dealt with loans. The prohibition against calling someone a mamzer or otherwise cast aspersions about the legal validity of his or her parents' marriage. The permission for the estate of a deceased person to be used to educate his or her children, even if the deceased indicated some other specific use for the funds. There were many other decrees that dealt with various aspects of Jewish legal, financial, and religious life of the times.[8] In 1223 a third synod was held in the Rhineland community, this time in Speyer. The main focus of this synod was the "Chalitzah takkana," but other decrees were discussed, including the prohibition against a one person either placing or lifting a cherem. To be either placed or lifted, such bans needed more than one community leader to agree. Notable attendees of this third synod included Elazar Rokeach and David ben Shaltiel.[9] Modern adherence[edit] While parts of various decrees still remain in force, the majority of the Takkanot Shum are no longer considered in force by most Ashkenazic Jewry. The decrees were instituted to deal with specific religious and sociological problems of the time, and were not considered to be placed in force for perpetuity, but for only as long as such issues existed.[10] However, there are two specific decrees still considered active today: the Dowry takkana and the Chalitzah takkana.[7] Dowry takkana[edit] At this time it was common to marry off daughters quite young, as soon as a suitable husband could be found and a dowry put together.[11] Combined with childhood diseases and a high general mortality rate this meant that it was not uncommon for young people to die within a short time of marriage, before their spouses had formed lasting relationships with their families. Under Jewish inheritance law, a husband is his wife's sole heir, but a wife does not inherit from her husband. Thus, no matter who died, the dowry, which represented a substantial sacrifice by the wife's parents for their daughter's happiness, would end up with the husband or his family. As a result, parents became reluctant to give their daughters large dowries, which in turn led to difficulty in finding them husbands.[9] Therefore the synod of Troyes, led by Rabbenu Tam, decreed that if a husband or wife dies within a year of marriage without leaving a surviving child, the dowry would revert to the parents who had given it; if the death was within two years half the dowry would revert.[12] While Rabbenu Tam rescinded this decree before his death, it was reaffirmed by his students in the first synod of SHUM.[9] This decree is today incorporated by reference into the standard Ashkenazi prenuptial contract (tena'im), with the phrase "and in case of absence [a euphemism for death] it will stand as the decree of ShUM"; in some communities even this elliptical mention of death is thought unlucky at a wedding, so it is merely hinted at with the cryptic phrase "and in case, etc."[13] Even if it is not explicitly referenced at all, or if there is no contract, it is assumed that the parties consented to it unless it is explicitly excluded.[14] Chalitzah takkana[edit] Engraving of a chalitzah ceremony When a husband died childless, there is a mitzvah for a surviving brother to perform either yibbum or halizah. Already in the times of the Talmud, performing yibbum was deprecated in favor of halitza for various reasons.[15][16] The decrees enacted in the various synods of SHUM dealt with the time span allowed and the disbursement of the deceased's property after halitzah.[9] The original decree, discussed at all three synods of SHUM, instituted a time limit of three months after the husband's death within which to perform yibbum or halitzah (although yibbum was rarely, if ever, performed) and after the halitzah, a beth din would decide upon the disbursement of the estate, with no recourse for the brother performing halitzah to subsequently sue. This decree was yet again re-affirmed 60 years later by Meir of Rothenburg.[9] However, in 1381, another synod was held in Mainz that changed the disbursement—instituting an even split between the widow and all surviving brothers. This was a change from previous tradition in which, most often, the brother performing the halitzah would receive the ketubah monies, as well as usually receiving most, if not all, of the surviving estate. This version is the second of the decrees still enforced today.[10] See also[edit] German Jews Jewish community of Speyer Posek References[edit] ^ Hirschman, Raphael (May 27, 2009). Ben Nun, Dov, ed.

Thaumatrope
A thaumatrope is an optical toy that was popular in the 19th century. A disk with a picture on each side is attached to two pieces of string. When the strings are twirled quickly between the fingers the two pictures appear to blend into one due to the persistence of vision.[1]
Both sides of a thaumatrope from 1825 (click for a simulation of its appearance in use) A thaumatrope is an optical toy that was popular in the 19th century. A disk with a picture on each side is attached to two pieces of string. When the strings are twirled quickly between the fingers the two pictures appear to blend into one due to the persistence of vision.[1] Thaumatropes can provide an illusion of motion when two stages of a figure in motion are depicted, but no examples are known to have been produced before the introduction of the first widespread animation device: the phénakisticope. Examples of common thaumatrope pictures include a bare tree on one side of the disk, and its leaves on the other, or a bird on one side and a cage on the other. They often also included riddles or short poems, with one line on each side. Thaumatropes are often seen as important antecedents of motion pictures and in particular of animation. This is partly due to many film historians' belief that the associated theory of persistence of vision explains the physiological basis for movies, although this was disproved in 1912. Contents 1 Etymology 2 Invention 3 Commercial production 4 Thaumatropes in popular culture 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Etymology[edit] The coined name translates roughly as "wonder turner", from Ancient Greek: ????? "wonder" and ?????? "turn". Invention[edit] In 2012, it was reported that a prehistoric thaumatrope had been discovered in the Chauvet Caves in France,[2] but it is very uncertain if this little disc was actually perceived as a thaumatrope when it was made. The invention of the thaumatrope is usually credited to John Ayrton Paris. Paris was said to have used one to demonstrate persistence of vision to the Royal College of Physicians in London in 1824.[citation needed] Charles Babbage recalled in 1864 that the thaumatrope was invented by the geologist William Henry Fitton after he (Babbage) had told Fitton how the astronomer John Herschel had made him see two sides of a shilling at once by spinning it.[3] Commercial production[edit] The first commercial thaumatrope was registered at Stationers' Hall on April 2, 1825 and published by W. Phillips in London as 'The Thaumatrope; being Rounds of Amusement or How to Please and Surprise By Turns', sold in boxes of 12 or 18 discs. It included a sheet with mottoes or riddles for each disc, often with a political meaning. Paris was widely regarded as the author, but wasn't mentioned on the product or its packaging and he later claimed in a letter to Michael Faraday "I was first induced to publish it, at the earnest desire of my late friend Wm Phillips. (...) I may add that I never put my name to it".[4] The steep price of a set (seven shilling for 12 discs or half a guinea for 18) was criticized, half a guinea would have been about a week's pay for an average worker.[4] It was also defended: its inventor should be able to earn something from his invention while it was new, before it was widely copied as seen before with the kaleidoscope.[5] Paris later claimed he gained £150,- from its sales in the United Kingdom.[4] As expected pirate copies soon became common and were much cheaper. The 'Thaumatropical Amusement' was available in boxes of six discs for one shilling.[4] Although the toy became popular original copies are now very rare; only one set produced W. Phillips is currently known to be in the collection of Richard Balzer and a single disc at the Cinematheque Francaise.[4] Other early publishers across the continent included Alphonse Giroux & Compagnie in France and Trentsensky in Austria. Thaumatropes in popular culture[edit] In the 2013 video game "BioShock Infinite" the bird and the cage thaumatrope is used several times. In the 2011 Martin Scorsese film Hugo, the final scene begins in the middle of a conversation about cinema precursors, including the thaumatrope. In the 2006 Christopher Nolan film The Prestige, Michael Caine's character repeatedly uses a thaumatrope as a way of explaining persistence of vision. In the 1999 Tim Burton film "Sleepy Hollow" a bird and cage thaumatrope is demonstrated by Johnny Depp. The 1827 book Philosophy in Sport made Science in Earnest, being an attempt to illustrate the first principles of natural philosophy by the aid of popular toys and sports[6] featured the thaumatrope and warned against inferior copies. The chapter head was illustrated with a drawing by George Cruikshank of a man demonstrating the thaumatrop to a girl and a boy. It was first published anonymously, but posthumous editions were credited to John Ayrton Paris.

Essay on the First Principles of Government
Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768) is an early work of modern liberal political theory by 18th-century British polymath Joseph Priestley.
Title page to Joseph Priestley's Essay Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768) is an early work of modern liberal political theory by 18th-century British polymath Joseph Priestley. Contents 1 Genesis of work 2 See also 3 Notes 4 Bibliography Genesis of work[edit] Priestley's friends urged him to publish a work on the injustices borne by religious Dissenters because of the Test and Corporation Acts, a topic to which he had already alluded in his Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life (1765). Between 1660 and 1665, Parliament passed a series of laws that restricted the rights of dissenters: they could not hold political office, teach school, serve in the military or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they ascribed to the thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. In 1689, a Toleration Act was passed that restored some of these rights, if dissenters subscribed to 36 of the 39 articles (Catholics and Unitarians were excluded), but not all Dissenters were willing to accept this compromise and many refused to conform. Throughout the 18th century Dissenters were persecuted and the laws against them were erratically enforced. Dissenters continually petitioned Parliament to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, claiming that the laws made them second-class citizens. The situation worsened in 1753 after the passage of Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act which stipulated that all marriages must be performed by Anglican ministers; some refused to perform Dissenting weddings at all.[1] In order to defend Dissenters, the text rearticulates John Locke's arguments from the Two Treatises on Government (1689), but it also makes a useful distinction between political and civil rights and argues for protection of extensive civil rights.[2] Priestley distinguishes between a private and a public sphere of governmental control; education and religion, in particular, he maintains, are matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. As Kramnick states, "Priestley's fundamental maxim of politics was the need to limit state interference on individual liberty."[3] For early liberals like Priestley and Jefferson, the "defining feature of liberal politics" was its emphasis on the separation of church and state.[4] In a statement that articulates key elements of early liberalism, Priestley wrote: It must necessarily be understood, therefore, that all people live in society for their mutual advantage; so that the good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great standard by which every thing relating to that state must finally be determined.[5] Priestley acknowledged that revolution was necessary at times but believed that Britain had already had its only necessary revolution in 1688, although his later writings would suggest otherwise. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon individual freedom.[6] Essay on Government went through three English editions and was translated into Dutch.

Administrative law in the People's Republic of China
Administrative law in the People's Republic of China was virtually non-existent before the economic reform era. Since the 1980s, the People's Republic of China has constructed a new legal framework for administrative law, establishing control mechanisms for overseeing the bureaucracy and disciplinary committees for the Communist Party of China. However, many have argued that the usefulness of these laws are vastly inferior in terms of controlling government actions, largely because of institutional and systemic obstacles like a weak judiciary, poorly trained judges and lawyers, and corruption.

Administrative Supervision Law (?????) Administrative Reconsideration Law (?????) State Civil Servant Provisional Regulations (?????????) State Compensation Law (?????) Administrative Penalties Law (?????) Adiminstrative Compulsory Law??????? v t e During the late 1970s and early 1980s, economic reforms called for an expansive role for government, and little attention was paid to administrative law. The 1982 Constitution contained provisions regarded administrative procedures, compensation, and the right to sue.[1] As the Constitution is not directly justiciable, between 1982 and 1988, there were more than 130 implementing laws and regulations which provided for administrative litigation in specific instances.[2] By the end of 1988, the Supreme People's Court had established an administrative law division and more than 1400 local courts had created administrative panels to hear administrative cases.[3] In 1987, drafting of an Administrative Procedure Law (?????) began. The ALL was passed in 1989 and went into effect on 1 October 1990. This law made it possible for individuals to bring a case against the administration and also laid down the relevant criteria and procedures for administrative litigation. The pace of administrative law legislation increased in the 1990s. In 1990, the Administrative Supervision Regulations (??????) and the Administrative Reconsideration Regulations (??????) were passed. Both regulations have since been amended and upgraded into laws. The 1993 State Civil Servant Provisional Regulations (?????????) changed the way government officials were selected and promoted, requiring that they pass exams and yearly appraisals, and introduced a rotation system. In 1994, the State Compensation Law (?????) was passed, followed by the Administrative Penalties Law (?????) in 1996. Administrative litigation[edit] The Administrative Procedure Law (APL) also known as the Administrative Litigation Law (ALL) allows parties to bring suit when their "legitimate rights and interests" are infringed by a specific administrative act of an administrative organ or its personnel.[4] The rights and obligations of the parties involved in an administrative litigation in China are important for realizing the targets, to protect the individuals’ rights and to limit the public powers set up by the Administrative Procedure Law, 1989. According to the law in China, a plaintiff refers to an individual, a legal person or other lawful organizations, whose rights have been directly affected by a defendant, viz. a public authority or its employee exercising public powers. This position has, however, experienced reformation and expansion by the Supreme People’s Court’s interpretation of law and the introduction of public interest litigation. A plaintiff is now guaranteed the right of access to a court, right to counsel, right to motion for conflict out, etc. These rights are to be exercised lawfully and should comply with the rules and instructions laid down by the courts. Since all the parties are equal before law, a defendant or a third person is guaranteed similar rights and also subject to similar obligations. A few differences, however, exist among them as well.[5] Several Chinese dissidents have invoked administrative law. In 1991, Guo Ruoji, formerly a professor at Nanjing University, sued the Communist Party committee of his university for stripping him of his professorship and banning him from travelling abroad. Both the Nanjing Intermediate Court and the Jiangsu Provincial Supreme People's Court ruled against Guo, on the grounds that acts of the Communist Party of China is not an administrative organ. Several other dissidents filed similar lawsuits against the government and the CPC. In 1993, Yuan Hongbing, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing, sued the university's CPC committee for banning a book he had edited, The Tide of History, which attacked leftist orthodox views. In 1998, Li Weiping, a Wuhan-based dissident, used the administrative law to sue the head of the city's Public Security Bureau for the seizure of his passport. Administrative reconsideration[edit] Administrative reconsideration offers a number of advantages over litigation under the Administrative Litigation Law. First, administrative reconsideration is free of charge.[6] Second, administrative reconsideration bodies may consider both the legality and appropriateness of administrative decisions.[7] Third, Parties may challenge not only the specific act, but in some cases the abstract act on which it is based.[8] Supervisory organs[edit] In 1986 the Ministry of Supervision was restored, and in 1993 it was merged with the CPC Discipline Committee system. In 1990, the State Council passed the Administrative Supervision Regulations, which were subsequently amended and upgraded to a law in 1997. The ministry and its subordinate bodies function somewhat like ombudsmen in other jurisdictions. Supervisory organs are charged with overseeing government and administrative officials and their appointed personnel. Whereas courts are generally limited to examining the legality of administrative acts, supervision organs may look into the appropriateness of administrative decisions. Supervisory organs may conduct discovery on administrative departments and officials, issue injunctions to cease acts in violation of law or disciplinary rules, temporarily remove or seal evidence, among other powers.

In 2004, Gaines left the band and was replaced by Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar) but rejoined in 2009. Formed in 1983 as Roxx Regime, the band soon changed their musical message to reflect their Christian beliefs, and the band's name was also changed to Stryper. They went on to become the first overtly Christian heavy metal band to gain acceptance in the mainstream.[2] In 1983, they signed with major label Enigma Records and released their debut album The Yellow and Black Attack. In the mid-1980s, Stryper enjoyed their most successful period beginning with the release of To Hell with the Devil, which achieved platinum sales status. Stryper went on to release two more gold albums before breaking up in 1992. In 2003, Stryper came out of retirement for a reunion tour and subsequently signed a multi-album contract with Big3 Records in 2005. In 2013 they signed a multi-album deal with Frontiers Records, and have released Second Coming, which includes 14 re-recorded songs from their first three albums and an album, No More Hell to Pay, released on November 5, 2013. Fallen on October 16, 2015.

Stryper's drummer, Robert Sweet, also created a backronym for their name: "salvation through redemption, yielding peace, encouragement and righteousness".[5] History[edit] Foundation and mainstream success (1975–1990)[edit] The Sweet brothers became Christians[clarification needed] in 1975, but began to pull away from their faith. The Sweet brothers rejoined the church after their friend Kenny Metcalf (their first tour keyboardist) persuaded them to do so.[6][7] Inspired by bands such as Van Halen, but distressed by their message, they sought to form a band that would extol their worldview and beliefs.[7] Stryper was originally known as Roxx Regime and composed of brothers Michael Sweet on lead vocals and lead guitar and Robert Sweet on drums while Eric Johnson played bass, rounding out the trio. Oz Fox eventually joined the band.[6] Before Oz Fox joined the band, a number of guitarists almost joined Roxx Regime, including Doug Aldrich and C.C. DeVille.[8] The name "Stryper" was adopted when bassist Tim Gaines joined the band though the label urged the band to change its name. The Bible scripture, from a passage in Isaiah 53:5, "By His stripes we are healed" became part of the band's logo. Shortly afterward, they released the EP The Yellow and Black Attack on July 21, 1984. During this period, Stryper opened for bands like Ratt and Bon Jovi, leading some fans and critics to claim that they were not a true Christian band. Stryper's first full-length album, Soldiers Under Command, released on May 15, 1985, was the band's first gold record. Capitalizing on this unexpected success, and in an attempt to make up for the EP's extremely limited release (fewer than 200,000 copies), their record label Enigma re-released The Yellow and Black Attack on August 10, 1986 with two new tracks and new cover art. Stryper's third album, To Hell with the Devil, was released on October 24, 1986 and went platinum after spending three months on Billboard's album charts,[9] eventually selling more than 2 million copies. In addition to being Stryper's most successful record, it was both the first contemporary Christian music and Christian metal album to achieve this feat.[6] "Calling on You", "Free" and "Honestly" were hugely popular MTV hits in 1987—so much so, that "Free" and "Honestly" both became most-requested songs on the show Dial MTV. They were also the second Christian band to get any airplay on MTV, Degarmo & Key having been the first with their song "666."[10] "Honestly" is Stryper's highest-charting song, peaking at No. 23 on the Top 40 charts.[7] The album received a Grammy Award nomination. Michael Sweet is the band's primary songwriter and has written most of the band's material throughout the years. He is also currently the band's producer. Bassist Tim Gaines did not participate in the recording of To Hell with the Devil, and for a short period of time prior to the release of the record he was replaced by Matt Hurich. Hurich was not with the band more than a month, although he was outfitted with a yellow and black striped bass and a racing costume. Brad Cobb played bass on the album.[10] However, when the promotional photos for the album were being shot, Gaines returned to the band and subsequently participated in its successful world tour. In 1987 the band headlined the Dynamo Open Air Festival in the Netherlands.[2] There is one To Hell with the Devil promotional photo of the band with Matt Hurich that was used in print advertisements. Prior to his time in Stryper, Hurich was in Leatherwolf. In 1989 he performed with his Stryper bass in the group Divine Right, which featured Kevin Brandow (Petra) on lead vocals and guitar. In the summer of 1986, Kenny Metcalf left touring with Stryper and Brent Jeffers replaced Kenny Metcalf on keyboards and toured with Stryper until 1990. Stryper's fourth album, In God We Trust, released on June 28, 1988, also went gold, and the song "Always There for You" briefly entered the lower levels of the pop charts, peaking at No.?71 despite it being another massive hit on MTV. However, the sound of the album was more pop-oriented than previous releases[6] and a number of critics, as well as Stryper fans, criticized the record for being over-produced. In addition, the image of the band was moving even closer to the glam metal look of the era,[11][12][13] giving fans something else to criticize. These factors led to lower sales, and the album spent only five weeks charting on Billboard.[9] The second single and video, "I Believe in You", peaked at No. 88 and a third single "Keep the Fire Burning" failed to chart. As with the previous album, Tim Gaines did not participate in the recording (Brad Cobb once again played bass) but later rejoined the group for another world tour. In God We Trust garnered two GMA Dove Awards for "Hard Music Album" and "Hard Music Song" for the title track.[14] Decline, break-up and solo projects (1990–1999)[edit] On August 21, 1990, Stryper released the controversial album Against the Law, which drastically changed the band's image and lyrical message.[6] While their earlier albums all had yellow and black colors in the covers and the lyrics spoke of God and salvation, Against the Law featured the band with black leather clothes and with no mention of the word "God" in the lyrics at all.[2] The band's musical sound was also heavier, closer to classic metal.[6] Drummer Robert Sweet said that the change of image and sound was in response to the criticism of the previous album and an attempt to leave behind their glam metal image. The album sold poorly. This was partly due to rumors in the press (both mainstream and Christian) that Stryper's music was trending towards a more mainstream sound as their Christian faith weakened.[6][15] Fans wondered why they covered the 1975 Earth Wind & Fire's "Shining Star". The video for it would not be a hit on MTV- the first Stryper video that was not. Two other videos followed for "Two Time Woman" and "Lady" which generated minimal airplay. However, many critics still considered the album to be Stryper's best musical production to date.[16] On July 20, 1991, after being signed to Hollywood Records, Stryper released a greatest hits collection called Can't Stop the Rock, which featured two new songs. One of which was the Gulf War inspired "Believe". The band continued to tour until February 1992, when frontman Michael Sweet departed the band citing artistic differences and to pursue a solo career.[6] In early 1992 Stryper fulfilled some commitments in Europe as a trio with Oz Fox on lead vocals. Soon after, on May 5, they performed two shows at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California. They asked Dale Thompson of the Christian metal band Bride to fill in on lead vocals hoping he would join the band.[17] It was during one of the concerts that Robert Sweet unexpectedly announced that Dale Thompson was going to be their new lead singer. This, however, was later denied by Thompson.[18] In early 1993 the band played several more European dates as a trio with their last show on March 27, 1993 in Sportzentrum, Greifensee, Switzerland. Upon returning to the United States, the remaining members decided to go their separate ways.[citation needed] Michael Sweet signed with Benson Records in 1993 and released his first solo effort in 1994. It went on to sell 300,000 units, achieve five No. 1 Christian CHR hit singles and three No. 1 rock singles.[citation needed] Michael Sweet has released multiple solo records which were hugely successful in the Christian music market.[citation needed] Oz Fox and Tim Gaines formed their own band, SinDizzy, and released the album He's Not Dead in 1998. Drummer Robert Sweet played in several bands, among them Blissed, who released an album in 2002. Other bands include King James, dbeality, Final Axe, and The Seventh Power. Reunions and recent works (1999–present)[edit] The former members of Stryper first reunited in 1999, when Michael Sweet and SinDizzy were invited to play at a summer rock festival in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. As an encore, Sweet joined Oz Fox and Tim Gaines on stage and played several Stryper songs. Later, in 2000, the first "Stryper Expo" was held in New Jersey, and for the first time in 8 years the complete line-up of Stryper took the stage. That same year, a concert was held in Costa Rica at which the four members played together. A second "Stryper Expo" took place in Los Angeles in 2001.[6] Hollywood Records asked the former members of Stryper to record tracks for a new greatest hits compilation in 2003 7: The Best of Stryper. The compilation was released with two new songs, "Something" and "For You",[19] marking Stryper's first new music since the early 1990s. A tour followed in support. The band played 36 shows in the United States and finished the tour in San Juan, Puerto Rico. A live album, titled 7 Weeks: Live in America, 2003, was released the following year, and the concert in Puerto Rico was filmed for a live DVD produced and directed by Jack Edward Sawyers. However, that show in Puerto Rico proved to be the last for the original line-up of Stryper until their 2010 reunion. Gaines and the band parted ways in 2004 before they were slated to play Disney's Night of Joy in Orlando. Michael's bassist on his previous solo tours, Tracy Ferrie, replaced him.[20] After the "Night of Joy" show and with new found energy, Stryper decided to go back into the studio to record a new CD, Reborn and another tour followed in the fall of 2004. Stryper's next album, Reborn, was released on August 16, 2005, and was the band's first full-length CD of original material in 15 years. It was produced by Michael Sweet. The new album received a positive response from fans and critics, some of whom labeled Reborn as one of the best albums of that year.[21] With a more modern sound incorporating aspects of alternative rock and grunge, along with fewer guitar solos, the new record updates their style while keeping the Stryper identity. The record was written by Michael Sweet.[22] The lyrics also have returned to the band's familiar themes of God and salvation. In 2006, the band released the DVD Greatest Hits: Live in Puerto Rico with Music Video Distributors. Stryper was scheduled to open for extreme thrash metal band Slayer, headlining in Mexico. A few months later, Slayer pulled out of the Mexican tour and cancelled their headline for personal reasons.[23][24][25] In November 2006, Stryper announced new management. They also announced a follow-up to Reborn tentatively due in early to mid 2007. However, that February saw lead singer Michael Sweet postponing the release of the new album two days before its recording was to begin. Sweet's wife Kyle had been diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer, and the new album was put on hold so that he could care for his family and ailing wife. She underwent surgery and treatment from February 14 to July 14. In April 2008, Kyle announced that her cancer had returned as of October 2007. The new album was in the mixing stage as of January 2008, and Sweet said that it should be released in July or August.[26] Michael Sweet performed with the band Boston in 2007 and was asked to join the band as co-lead vocalist and guitarist and toured with Boston in 2008 with Styx as the opening act. On March 5, 2009, Michael Sweet's wife, Kyle, died from cancer.[27] Murder by Pride was released on July 21, 2009, with the lead single "Peace of Mind" preceding it. Since late 2008, Tim Gaines has played bass in concert with Tourniquet. The band has since added the song "To Hell with the Devil" to their set list to highlight Gaines' involvement. Oz Fox joined Tourniquet on stage in Germany to perform the same song. The Covering, a collection of 12 cover songs from bands that inspired Stryper and helped to shape the band's sound and musical identity was on Big3 Records/Sony and was produced by Michael Sweet. Along with the covers, it includes a new, original recording: "God". On September 14, 2010, it was announced that the album's first single, a cover of Black Sabbath's "Heaven and Hell", was available for download on iTunes. The album was released on February 15, 2011.[28] The band signed a deal with Frontiers Records[29] and released Second Coming March 25, 2013.[30] The album features fourteen classic songs re-recorded as well as two new songs. No More Hell to Pay, was completed on May 29, 2013 and was released on November 5, through Frontiers Records.[31] Live at the Whisky, a CD/DVD combination recorded at the Whisky A Go Go, was released in September 2014.[32] Fallen, was released on October 16, 2015.[33] Music and image[edit] "To Hell with the Devil" Sample of "To Hell with the Devil" by Stryper, from To Hell with the Devil (1986). Representing Stryper's rock/metal style, this is one of the most popular songs from the band's best selling album. Problems playing this file? See media help. During the 1980s, Stryper represented the popular glam metal style of the time,[11] characterized by highly visual performances, twin guitar solos, Michael Sweet's high-pitched, multi-octave screams and big hair. A characteristic element of the band was that all their outfits, sets, and instruments were painted in yellow and black stripes. The number of the stripes represented in various stage props and costumes increased during the show, leading up to In God We Trust. The band explained the symbolism of the stripes: a direct reference to the whiplash scourges given by Pontius Pilate to Jesus, derived from the King James Version of the Bible's Isaiah 53:5.[34] A trademark of the band's stage act was drummer Robert Sweet's practice of turning his enormous drum kit sideways to the audience so that the crowd could see him playing. This is why Robert was more often called a "visual timekeeper" rather than a drummer.[35] Apart from its ubiquitous yellow and black stripes, Stryper had other distinctive trademarks. During concerts, Stryper threw Bibles to the concert crowd— editions of the New Testament with the band's logo stickers affixed to them.[citation needed] As a protest against "666" symbols popular among many heavy metal fans of the era, Stryper promoted an alternative numerological symbol; Stryper's trademark use of the "777" symbol subsequently became quite popular among Christian metalheads. Although the number "777" is not actually referenced by the Bible (as opposed to 666, which is famously mentioned in The Book of Revelation as The Number of the Beast) the number "7" is traditionally (in Christian symbolism) associated with divine perfection. Some of the band's stage sets included the crossed out symbols of "devil" and "666".[citation needed] The Los Angeles Times reported in 1985 that "the band gets sullen fans of Twisted Sister cheering and poking stubby 'one way' fingers heavenward—a refutation of the double-fingered 'devil horns' salute of many metal groups".[36] Legacy[edit] Stryper is recognized as the first openly Christian heavy metal band to gain recognition in the mainstream music world.[2] Their message of salvation has also made them popular with some elements of the media.[who?] Mark Joseph states "The Yellow and Black Attack was propelled by the group's success in Japan, which was largely due to an endorsement of the band by famed rock critic Masa Itoh, the man who ruled the Japanese hard rock/metal scene, who many fans looked to for his evaluation of bands. Itoh had heard of Stryper, gotten in touch with their manager Daryn Hinton, and liked what he heard. When he gave the band a positive review in Japan's heavy metal bible Burrn! magazine and played the album on his radio show, Stryper suddenly found themselves at the top of the metal heap in Japan with a record that was outselling Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, and every other metal band."[37] This led to the band signing with CBS Sony in Japan. Stryper has not been free of controversy. Many Christian critics did not approve of the group's association with the heavy metal subculture, which has often been associated with Satanic imagery.[15] Other Christian detractors viewed the band’s flashy costumes as incongruous with the modesty in dress often associated with sincere practitioners of devout Christianity.[38] Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart was a particularly prominent critic, likening Stryper's practice of distributing the New Testament at their shows to "casting pearls before swine".[6] Swaggart's condemnation may not have been a surprise, however, as Stryper was supported by the rival Jim Bakker ministries, who are thanked on several Stryper albums. A 1985 CCM magazine article by Chris Willman, who was also writing for the Los Angeles Times, stated that "Stryper was the target of scattered picketing, boycott threats, and righteous denunciations". For example, concert-goers were often greeted by protesters armed with bullhorns and distribution of Gospel tracts. "It was just like if Ozzy Osbourne was there. They gave us the same treatment, laughs Daryn Hinton."[39] In 1990, Rolling Stone magazine reported that the band had become disillusioned with Christian music.[6] This, combined with a notable shift in tone in the band's lyrics, led to Against the Law being banned from many Christian bookstores. The Benson Company, Stryper's sole tie to the Christian market, dropped this album from distribution.[10] Stryper has sold over 10 million recordings worldwide,[10] and it is estimated that two-thirds of their albums were bought by non-Christians.[6] In 2011 Stryper won the readers choice award for Best Christian / Gospel Artists & Bands. Kim Jones of About.com states, "With 44% of the vote, hard rock legends Stryper beat out all of their competition to be named the best Christian hard rock band, bringing to mind the old adage, 'like a fine wine, some things just get better with age.'"[40] Ian Christe, author of the heavy metal history book Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal, mentions the album To Hell with the Devil in his book as one of the landmarks of the glam metal movement.[41] The song "To Hell with the Devil" appears on the Rhino Records release The Heavy Metal Box, a compilation mainly of secular classic metal bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Metallica, as well as hair bands like Twisted Sister and Poison.[42] In popular culture[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(October 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Marvel comic series Runaways refers to Stryper as being a Christian glam band in Vol. 4 True Believers. UK band Half Man Half Biscuit refers to Stryper in the chorus of their song "Christian Rock Concert" from the 1991 album McIntyre, Treadmore and Davitt. In the 2009 film Whip It, Ellen Page's character "Bliss" distinctively wears a Stryper t-shirt throughout the film, which originally belonged to her mother, Marcia Gay Harden's character, and is referred to by the daughter as the only cool thing, that you own. On the Bloodhound Gang song "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" on One Fierce Beer Coaster the lyric "Or do you own a record by Stryper?" is a part of a list of reasons for doing what the title of the song suggests. In the 2013 film Pain & Gain, Dwayne Johnson's character, while at a gun shop, pretends to be doing security work for the band in order to have access to select weaponry available only to law enforcement.

Sosa’s has been extensively exhibited in the Mexico City area, his home state of Tlaxcala and has been exhibited in the United States and Germany. His work has been recognized with various awards, publications, tributes and membership in the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana. Contents 1 Background 2 Career 3 Recognition 4 Artistry 5 References 6 Bibliography Background[edit] Sosa (full name José Hermenegildo Sosa Zamora) was born in the small rural community of San Andrés Buenavista, Tlaxcala, northwest of Mexico City.[1] He comes from a family of farm workers, including his father Rafael Sosa, who was also an ejido (communal farm) leader. His mother was Cirenia Zamora, a homemaker, with Sosa being the twelfth of their fourteen children.[2][3] His creative tendencies appeared early and were encouraged by his parents;[4] however; his father was killed when Sosa was only five.[5] This forced his mother to leave San Andrés with her three youngest children, which included Hermenegildo, and live in the larger town of Apizaco, Tlaxcala, arriving when Sosa was eight.[3] Sosa had to start working while very young, doing a number of jobs to support himself and his family.[5] This included herding sheep, which later influenced his art as it allowed him to observe nature and the cycle of the seasons.[2][3] Economics and his family situation meant that he began and completed school late, but he maintained his determination to get an education, which in later life would allow him to support his mother and siblings.[4][6] At age ten, he went to Mexico City to work as a domestic service at a private home, initially sending money home to his mother.[2][3] He began primary school at age twelve at the Centro Escolar Revolución, but in his fourth year won a recital competition among primary schools in Mexico City. In 1961, at age 15, he is reunited with his mother, who had remarried and moved to Mexico City as well. Sosa went on to study middle school at the Maestra Guadalupe Núñez y Parra School in 1964, the same year he exhibited a series of watercolors he did at the school. The school promoted his work.[3] However his stepfather opposed Sosa’s artistic ambitions and eliminated his chances of entering the National School of Arts (ENAP) in 1967 by destroying needed documents in Sosa’s face.[2][3] So a few weeks later, Sosa took a painting class at the Casa del Lago, an institution supported by the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Here he learned the basics of composition, working during his free time and on any material from napkins to actual canvas.[7] The teacher of this class, José Rivera, arranged to allow Sosa to attend an ENAP class as an unmatriculated student with Fermín Rojas, and Sosa participated in an exhibition with the class. Rojas recognized the young man’s talent and encouraged him to continue his studies.[8] However, Sosa could not continue at the school because of his lack of credentials.[9] Instead, he finished middle school at age 23 and was able to get steady employment a buy a modest house in the Granjas Valle de Guadalupe, Seccion B, a housing tract just outside the bounds of Mexico City. This allowed him to distance himself from his stepfather while maintaining a relationship with his mother.[9] By age 26, Sosa had completed high school and enrolled at La Esmeralda, studying from 1973 to 1978, when he earned his bachelors in visual arts.[2][10] In 1988, he received his masters in fine arts from the same institution.[11] Sosa learned various styles of drawing and painting, but his rural background in part led him to be interested in landscape painting.[9] His art studies allowed him to look at the landscapes around his hometown in a new light, the fields, farms, vegetation, and the colors of the different seasons, along with the sky both day and night.[12] In the 1970s, this format was undervalued and not taught at La Esmeralda .[10] For this reason, Sosa taught himself the art by studying the works of famous landscape artists.[2] Career[edit] Sosa’s career as a painter and teacher has extended from the 1970s to the present.[12] By 1973 his work already gained some recognition from participation in a number of exhibitions, which earned him opportunities to teach classes. This allowed him to leave the more strenuous labor he had done before. Most of his teaching career has been with his alma mater La Esmeralda. In 1980s, he and a group of students here at the time lobbied the administration to hold landscape painting workshops to be taught by Sosa.[13] They were successful, with the classes taking place on intermittent weekends.[14] In 1982, he passed the exam at La Esmeralda that permitted him to become a full-time instructor.[2] Sosa had exhibited his work as a student in various collective shows, which his first two individual exhibitions coming in 1978. Just before graduating La Esmeralda, he organized an exhibition at a small restaurant in the Colonia Guerrero neighborhood in Mexico City,[9] which was followed by a second at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional in the same city.[11] Since then he has had individual exhibitions at the Nishizawa Cultural Center, Atizapán de Zaragoza (2010), Hermenegildo Sosa Cultural Center, Tlaxco (2009),Teatro San Benito Abad, Cuautitlán Izcalli (2009), Wimmer Gallery, Munich (2008), National Agriculture Museum, University of Chapingo (2008), Tlaxcala Art Museum (2008), Tlaxcala State Fair (2007), José María Velasco Museum, Toluca (2005, 2007, 2010), Salón de la Plástica Mexicana (2000, 2010), Galería Tere Hass, Mexico City (1998), Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Estado de México (1998), Casa de Cultura Juventino Rosas, Mexico City (1996), Museo de Arte Contemporáneo Ateneo de Yucatán (1996), Museo Universitario Contemporáneo de Arte (UNAM) (1995), Aristos Gallery (UNAM) (1994), Modern Art Museum of Toluca (1993), Casa de Cultura in Tlaxco (1992), Marstelle Galería de Arte, Mexico City (1991, 1995), Offices of INFONAVIT, Mexico City (1990), Galería Lourdes Chumacero, Mexico City (1989, 1997), Office of the National Lottery, Mexico City (1987), Centro Cultural José Martí, Mexico City (1986), Casa de la Cultura de Temascalcingo, State of Mexico (1984), Galerías Aura, Mexico City (1984, 1986), Pinacoteca de Tlaxcala (1982, 1988), Galerías de La Esmeralda (1982) and the Universidad de Xalapa (1980).[15][16][17] In addition, an exhibition of his work called Nuestra Casa (Our House/Home) toured his native state in 1992, and has been exhibited in numerous collective shows in Mexico and the United States, including New York, Saint Paul, MN, Scottsdale, AZ and Chicago.[11][18] The artist’s works can be found in public and private collections in Mexico, the United States and Germany,[2] including those of the Modern Art Museum of Toluca, the Pinacoteca de Tlaxcala, the Museum of the City of León, Guanajuato, the Casa de Moneda, in Quito, Ecuador, the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (Zacatenco) and the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Estado de México. In 2006 a selection of his work became a part of the permanent display on landscapes at the José María Velasco Museum in Toluca.[15] The work Poema was reproduced on a series of Mexican national lottery tickets in 1994, followed by Mis tres amores in 1995.[15] Recognition[edit] Sosa’s work has been recognized in a number of ways. On several occasions, pieces have won awards such as second place Painting Competition of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana (2005), second place at the Exposición Concurso Homenajo a Francisco Goitia at the Aneteo Anáhuac (1991), the V Bienal de Pintura Rufino Tamayo (1990), the acquisition prize (second place) at the XXI Exposición Concurso de Maestros de Artes Plásticas of SNTE (1982) and was chosen to represent Mexico at the IX Bienal Internacional de Arte in Valparaíso, Chile (1989) .[2][15] His work has been critiqued and written about by the likes of Alí Chumancero and Berta Taracena,[19] and various books have been published such as El Color de la Vida presented at the Tlaxcala State Fair in 2007.[16] Various organizations have held tributes to the artist including Tepecuicatl Concert Hall in the north of Mexico City (1996), José María Velasco Museum in Toluca (2010) and the Pinacoteca de Tlacala in 1988.[15][20] Sosa was accepted into the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana and in the early 2000s he served as the board’s president.[21] In 2011 the city of Tlaxco inaugurated the Hermenegildo Sosa Cultural Center,[2] and in 2012 he received the Galardón San Benito Abad from the Unviersidad del Lago in Cuautitlán Izcalli.[22] Sosa’s teaching has received various recognitions from La Esmeralda.[15][22] Artistry[edit] Artist at home with one of his works in the background Sosa’s work has focused on painting with some drawing, with his best-known work being depictions of the nature of rural Mexico, especially that of his home state of Tlaxcala with intense colors and forms, with colors such as turquoise, violet and yellow. Most of his works were painted in situ, looking directly at what he was capturing on canvas.[2][18][23] Common elements include foliage, mountains, volcanoes, with flowers used to symbolize life.[23] His depictions of nature are colorful and connect earth and sky. They also indicate movement and metamorphosis.[24] Most of his depictions of rural Mexico relate to his experience of this environment, a is a celebration of Mexican life.[4][18] However, some works can depict the negative, especially its hardships.[25] The change from rural to urban life made a profound impact on the artist during his life.[4] His landscape work was not limited to rural scenes but urban ones as well, especially around the edges of cities.[26] Whiile his rural scenes are generally positive and colorful, his depictions of urban life tend to be dramatic and chaotic, depicting pollution, buildings in poor condition and traffic.[2][27] demonstrating urban sprawl and its effects on the environment and the poor.[26] Urban life is depicted as chaotic, bitter and hard.[25] He also has done still lifes, interior environments, including furniture and nude figures in some kind of setting.[28] His still lifes are an exploration of form and color, with the creativity most apparent in the choice of elements and the visual angle.[2] Drawings tend to be in black and white, especially in an early “gray period.”[29] Sosa’s work blends elements of impressionism and expressionism with some abstraction.[2][18] Influences include the works of Dr Atl, Francisco Goitia, José María Velasco, José Clemente Orozco, Joaquín Clausell, Rufino Tamayo, Luis Nishizawa, Vincent van Gogh, William Turner, Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet and Cezanne.[2][30][31] According to Alí Chumacero: His main world, his achievement as an artist, is the composition of flowers, plants, mountains, volcanos and colors. Flowers are a tribute to life, illuminated by the Sun, along with marigolds and sunflowers that appear in the shadows on occasion. Sosa’s work is also metamorphosis, movement, as much in the clouds and sky as in the field and earth, in the yellows of the flowers and the green that extends all the way to the horizon and joins with the sky that acquires the yellow tones of the Sun.[32] References[edit] ^ a b Rivera, p.9,11 ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o Lara Cantú, María Guadalupe, ed.

Phalke could not find a woman who agreed to act in the film; even prostitutes and dancing girls refused. Phalke saw Salunke, who had an effeminate figure and slender hands, and convinced him to play a female role. While Salunke was working for a monthly salary of 10 rupees, Phalke offered him 15 and Salunke agreed.[2][4] Salunke also acted in Phalke's Lanka Dahan (1917), played in the Hindu epic Ramayana. Salunke played the first double role in Indian cinema,[5][6] by playing both the male role of the hero Rama and the female role of his wife Sita, the heroine.[6] However, Salunke had developed a more muscular physique, by then and the audience could see his biceps even as he played the goddess Sita.[2][7] Salunke also acted in Satyanarayan (1922) directed by V.S. Nirantar and Phalke's Buddha Dev (1923). He was also the cinematographer on both films. Later, Salunke abandoned his acting career and fully concentrated on cinematography. Besides Nirantar and Phalke, he worked with G.V. Sane (who acted with Salunke in Raja Harishchandra) and Ganpat G. Shinde (co-starred with Salunke in Lanka Dahan) as directors. Last of his films as cinematographer were in 1931.[8] Films[edit] Salunke, during his film career spanning 18 years from 1913 to 1931, acted in various films including five in the female role, most of them were on Hindu mythological themes. He was also a cinematographer in a few films.[9] Selected filmography[edit] In female roles Raja Harishchandra (1913) Satyavadi Raja Harishchandra (1917) as Taramati Lanka Dahan (1922) in a double role as Seeta and also as Rama Satyanarayan (1922) Buddha Dev (1923), his last movie as an actress In several roles Ahiravan Mahiravan Vadh (1922) Haritalika (1922) Pandav Vanavas (1922) Satyanarayan (1922) Shishupala Vadh (1922) Wandering Soul (1923) Buddha Dev (1923) Gora Kumbhar (1923) Guru Dronacharya (1923) Jarasandha Vadha (1923) Kanya Vikraya (1923) Jayadratha Vadh (1924) Kanya Vikraya (1924) Ram Ravan Yuddha (1924) Shivajichi Agryahun Sutaka (1924) Sundopasund (1924) Anant Vrat (1925) Kakashebanchya Dolyat Jhanjhanit Anjan (1925) Satyabhama (1925) Simantak Mani (1925) Datta Janma (1925) Bhakta Pralhad (1926) Bhim Sanjeevan (1926) Keechaka Vadh (1926) Sant Eknath (1926) Bhakta Sudama (1927) Draupadi Vastraharan (1927) Hanuman Janma (1927) Madalasa (1927) Vasantsena (1929) Khuda Parasta (1930) Amir Khan (1931) References[edit] ^ a b Brigitte Schulze (2003).

Ureohydrolase
A ureohydrolase is a type of hydrolase enzyme.[1]
Ureohydrolase Identifiers Symbol Ureohydrolase Pfam PF00491 InterPro IPR006035 PROSITE PDOC00135 Available protein structures: Pfam structures PDB RCSB PDB; PDBe; PDBj PDBsum structure summary A ureohydrolase is a type of hydrolase enzyme.[1] The ureohydrolase superfamily includes arginase (EC 3.5.3.1), agmatinase (EC 3.5.3.11), formiminoglutamase (EC 3.5.3.8) and proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (EC 3.5.3.22).[2] These enzymes share a 3-layer alpha-beta-alpha structure,[2][3][4] and play important roles in arginine/agmatine metabolism, the urea cycle, histidine degradation, and other pathways. Arginase, which catalyses the conversion of arginine to urea and ornithine, is one of the five members of the urea cycle enzymes that convert ammonia to urea as the principal product of nitrogen excretion.[5] There are several arginase isozymes that differ in catalytic, molecular and immunological properties. Deficiency in the liver isozyme leads to argininemia, which is usually associated with hyperammonemia. Agmatinase hydrolyses agmatine to putrescine, the precursor for the biosynthesis of higher polyamines, spermidine and spermine. In addition, agmatine may play an important regulatory role in mammals.[6] Formiminoglutamase catalyses the fourth step in histidine degradation, acting to hydrolyse N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate to L-glutamate and formamide. Proclavaminate amidinohydrolase is involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Clavulanic acid acts as an inhibitor of a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes that are used by various microorganisms to resist beta-lactam antibiotics. As a result, this enzyme improves the effectiveness of beta-lactamase antibiotics.[4][7] References[edit] ^ Ureohydrolases at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) ^ a b Lee J, Suh SW, Kim KH, Kim D, Yoon HJ, Kwon AR, Ahn HJ, Ha JY, Lee HH (2004).

He travelled to Paris at the age of 22 to study painting, where he fell under the influence of the impressionists. In 1910, he married a widow whose son, his stepson, grew up to be the artist Robert Wakeham Pilot.[2] Beginning in January 1918, Cullen served with Canadian forces in the First World War. He came to the attention of Lord Beaverbrook, who arranged for him to be commissioned as an "official war artist" along with Frederick Varley, J.W. Beatty and C. W. Simpson.[3] Exhibitions[edit] Galerie L'Art français exhibited his works.[4] Legacies of Impressionism in Canada: Three Exhibitions, January 31 to April 19, 2009 Vancouver Art Gallery Selected works[edit] The Mill Stream (ca 1905), National Gallery of Canada.

HMS Senegal
Two vessels that served the Royal Navy have been named Senegal:
Two vessels that served the Royal Navy have been named Senegal: Senegal was launched at Rotherhithe on 26 December 1760 as a 14-gun sloop of 292 tons (bm). She grounded while attempting to enter the harbour at Canso, Nova Scotia, on 22 August 1764 and foundered while being towed into the harbour.[1] Senegal was a sloop of 183 tons (formerly named the Racehorse) that the Royal Navy purchased in 1777 and armed with 16 guns. The French captured her on 15 August 1778.[2] HMS Zephyr recaptured her on 2 November 1780 off the Gambia River, but she blew up by accident at Gorée on 22 November.[3][4] Citations[edit] ^ Hepper (1994), p.47. ^ Hepper (1994), p.53. ^ The London Gazette: no. 12169. p. 2. 10 March 1781. ^ Hepper (1994), p.60.

Pirsig. An American remake, Barefoot, was released in 2014. Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Critical response 4 External links Plot[edit] The life of Nick Keller (Til Schweiger) can hardly be called well sorted. He stumbles from one temporary job to the next, and he has very serious problems with Heinrich, his rich and influential stepfather, as well as with his brother Viktor. Nick’s latest temporary job is as a cleaner in a psychiatric clinic, where he prevents the barefooted patient Leila (Wokalek) from committing suicide just as he is being fired from this latest employment. Leila’s story is also complex. The first nineteen years of her life she had been confined at home by her mother. She has been hospitalized in the clinic after her mother's death, but is desperate to leave. However, emotionally Leila is still a child. For example, everything that she is told, she takes literally; and she dislikes physical contact with strangers. The unexpected consequence of Nick’s saving Leila from hanging herself is that Leila secretly follows her saviour, in her nightdress and once again barefooted; and she appears in front of his door that night. After Leila adamantly refuses go back to the clinic, she and Nick go on a road trip together in order to attend his brother’s wedding to Nick's ex-girlfriend. During the trip the relationship between the two deepens significantly. However, after serious disputes with his family, Nick once again tries to hospitalize Leila. As a result, he has to confess to himself that he has fallen in love with her. Nick is then arrested for attempted kidnapping, and Leila is brought back to the clinic. Nick pretends to have mental problems so he can go into the clinic with Leila, but only after Leila once again attempts suicide does her doctor admit him. The last scene shows them together shopping in a supermarket some months later, after their release from the clinic.

Precomputation
In algorithms, precomputation is the act of performing an initial computation before run time to generate a lookup table that can be used by an algorithm to avoid repeated computation each time it is executed. Precomputation is often used in algorithms that depend on the results of expensive computations that don't depend on the input of the algorithm. A trivial example of precomputation is the use of hardcoded mathematical constants, such as ? and e, rather than computing their approximations to the necessary precision at run time.
Part of a 20th-century precomputed mathematical table of common logarithms. In algorithms, precomputation is the act of performing an initial computation before run time to generate a lookup table that can be used by an algorithm to avoid repeated computation each time it is executed. Precomputation is often used in algorithms that depend on the results of expensive computations that don't depend on the input of the algorithm. A trivial example of precomputation is the use of hardcoded mathematical constants, such as ? and e, rather than computing their approximations to the necessary precision at run time. In databases, the term materialization is used to refer to storing the results of a precomputation,[1][2] e.g. in a materialized view.[3][4] Contents 1 Overview 2 History 3 Examples 4 See also 5 References Overview[edit] Precomputing a set of intermediate results at the beginning of an algorithm's execution can often increase algorithmic efficiency substantially. This becomes advantageous when one or more inputs is constrained to a small enough range that the results can be stored in a reasonably sized block of memory. Because memory access is essentially constant in time complexity (except for caching delays), any algorithm with a component which has worse than constant efficiency over a small input range can be improved by precomputing values. In some cases efficient approximation algorithms can be obtained by computing a discrete subset of values and interpolating for intermediate input values, since interpolation is also a linear operation. History[edit] Before the advent of computers, printed lookup tables of values were used by people to speed up hand calculations of complex functions, such as in trigonometric tables, logarithm tables, and tables of statistical density functions[5] School children are often taught to memorize "times tables" to avoid calculations of the most commonly used numbers (up to 9 x 9 or 12 x 12). Even as early as 493 A.D., Victorius of Aquitaine wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in Roman numerals) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were "a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144" [6] Examples[edit] Even modern computer implementations of digital trigonometric functions often use precomputed lookup tables to either provide coefficients for interpolation algorithms or to initialise successive approximation algorithms. Many attacks on cryptosystems involve precomputation. Examples of large-scale precomputation as part of modern efficient algorithms include: Rainbow tables Perfect hashes The cube attack Precalculated BSP trees for visibility calculations in 3D graphics Radiosity precomputation for illumination in 3D graphics Compilers use precomputation extensively as a means of increasing the run-time speed of the resulting code: this precomputation can be regarded as in effect a form of partial evaluation of the program code itself. Examples of this sort of precomputation include dataflow analysis and strength reduction steps.

A place of tourist interest[edit] River Tungabhadra flows through this village, branching into seven streams. There are also seven kattes (platforms constructed of stones around a wide tree where a group of people sit for a chit-chat). The place is surrounded by more than a dozen hills. On the bank of the river there is the vrindavana (holy grave of Hindu saints, especially of those belonging to a matha or parampara(lineage)) of Sri Vasudhendra teertha who is the great grandson of Sri Raghavendra Swami. The Raghavendra mutt of Mantralayam administers the vrindavana. This place attracts many Brahmin tourists from all over Karnataka. Every year, on the sixth, seventh and eighth days ( namely shashthi, saptami and ashtami) of the ashvayuja mãsa of the Hindu calendar, the aãradhane (anniversary of the day on which the saint entered the vrindavana alive ) of Sri Vasudhendra teertha swamy is held in kenchanagudda. The river here is well known for its beautiful scenery. A song of the Kannada film Maanasa Sarovara titled Chanda Chanda was shot here.[3] Many remains of the era of Vijayanagara Empire are found around the village. There is a hydro-electric power plant across one of the seven branches of the river.[4] Hydro-electric power plant at kenchanagudda How to reach[edit] Kenchanagudda is located 5 km west of Siruguppa. There are two routes to kenchanagudda. When coming from Bellary along SH-19, take a left besides a petrol bunk, just before entering Siruguppa. The road, headed towards Kampli reaches the kenchanagudda village after 4 km. From the village, a small road tangential off the right of the main road leads to the vrindavana. To reach kenchanagudda from inside the Siruguppa town, follow the road leading to CNN school.

She was the second of Dr. and Mrs. Sarvis’ four children, following brother David Lieutellas (8 February 1913 – 27 June 1999) and joined later by sister Marion Elizabeth (26 January 1917 – 23 July 1997) and brother Alva Taylor (27 November 1924 – 15 March 1989). Her father served as a Professor of Sociology and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Nanking, where the family lived until they returned to the United States in 1926. In China, Mary grew up well-educated and well-off but aware of the poverty and resource deprivation that affected the lives of those outside the University community. Psychologist Erik Erikson commented that “her early memories concerned death, injustice, and separation: the death to which newborn Chinese girls were abandoned as too great an economic burden, and her own separation from her Chinese nurse.”[1] Erikson and others who knew Mary credit her girlhood experiences with injustice in China with her decision to enter medicine, specifically psychiatry. Young Mary was known to her peers as being a bit of a tomboy, willing to accept a dare and keen to set off fireworks. Her family nicknamed her “Buzzie,” and friends in Hiram, OH called her “Bill.” Education[edit] Mary Sarvis graduated from high school in Hiram, Ohio. She attended Vanderbilt for a year before completing her Bachelor’s in Psychology at Antioch College in 1937.[2] Her brother David also attended Antioch College, and the two pursued graduate degrees simultaneously at Yale University. David enrolled in the School of Drama and Mary attended the School of Medicine. Mary was one of only four women in her class and had the additional distinction of writing her thesis under the supervision of Marion Howard, a female physician. Mary became Dr. Sarvis in 1942, earning her medical degree following a thesis investigation into Bacterium necrophorum.[3] Dr. Sarvis returned to Ohio and aided the war effort by serving as the physician in charge of a Red Cross Blood Drive unit.[4] She completed her medical internship at Harlem Hospital in New York City, then crossed the country to serve her psychiatric residency at the relatively new Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Clinic in San Francisco. Dr. Sarvis remained a Bay Area resident the rest of her life. Later life[edit] Throughout her adult life, Dr. Sarvis resided in Oakland and Berkeley. She never married, but maintained close friendships with many other school guidance and mental health professionals. Many of these friends partnered with Dr. Sarvis on publications. Marianne Pennekamp of the Oakland School District coathored Collaboration in School Guidance. Lydia Rapoport and Blanche Garcia also cowrote articles with Dr. Sarvis for scholarly journals. Professional aims dominated her private life, and even these coauthors, who counted themselves close friends of Dr. Sarvis, knew little of her family background and personal history. In other ways, her work consumed her private life. When established channels failed to meet the needs of the individuals and communities she served, Dr. Sarvis took it upon herself to find solutions at personal cost. When a young man Dr. Sarvis knew from her work lacked the funds to pay for graduate school, for example, she provided him with a loan so he could pursue his schooling. Mary's sister Elizabeth "Betty" Luse commented that Mary was "so busy with her professional life that she did not have time for hobbies." Politically, Dr. Sarvis leaned left. Mayor Joseph E. Smith of Oakland invited her to serve on the “Committee for City Unity,” founded in 1947 as an effort to improve relations between people of different national, racial, and religious origins.” Dr. Sarvis opposed bureaucracy and supported diversity, arguing for the “defeat of the machine men” in local politics.[5] Agents recorded her presence at a 1953 meeting of the East Bay Committee for American Activities, a group formed “for the express purpose of opposing the House Committee [on Un-American Activities, HUAC].[6] Her brother David Sarvis lived in nearby Mill Valley and had a rich career in progressive drama, acting in the blacklisted communist film “Salt of the Earth." Death[edit] On June 16, 1965, Dr. Sarvis died at home while packing for a vacation. She was 50 years old. Officially, the cause of death was a heart attack brought on by a combination of alcohol and pills. Career[edit] Dr. Sarvis’ professional associations and obligations ranged widely between private practice, teaching, and work in public agencies. Oakland Schools[edit] In 1946, soon after she moved to the Bay Area, Dr. Sarvis became a consultant in individual guidance and development for the Oakland Public Schools, a position she held until her death.[7] Under the influence of Dr. Sarvis, Oakland pioneered a collaborative model for school guidance. Still a relatively new phenomenon in itself, in mid-century children’s psychiatric medicine was structured towards individual casework in standalone clinics. A teacher or other school personnel member might make an initial referral for a particular student, but the student’s treatment and progress was seldom disclosed to teachers, who likewise had no opportunity to give feedback to the clinician. In place of endless appointments working towards unclear goals, Dr. Sarvis steered the Oakland guidance counselors to identify and pursue “the next useful step” in collaboration with teachers, parents, principals, clinicians, and especially students themselves. The holistic model operated along the idea that small, measurable progress and not solutions should be the metric through which to assess guidance success. Individuals from a range of professions contributed their disciplinary and personal strengths towards taking this next useful step. The Oakland School District presented guidance workers with additional challenges. School and neighborhood demographics varied widely throughout the district. Dr. Sarvis and her colleagues needed a framework that allowed them to work with poverty-stricken urban slums, nontraditional family structures, and immigrant parents with little to no English-language skills. They found an interactive, flexible model achieved more lasting and more measurable success for their students. Dr. Sarvis and coworker Marianne Pennekamp wrote an account of the model, Collaboration in School Guidance. Their methods were tested in courses at the Berkeley School of Social Work and other locations across the country.[8] University of California, Berkeley[edit] Dr. Sarvis became a Professor at the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1959.[9] She taught a course on psychoanalysis in social work to second year graduate students and collaborated on publications with several other School of Social Welfare staff members, including Lydia Rapoport and Sally De Wees. Rapoport and colleague Beulah Parker praised Dr. Sarvis’ adeptness at apprehending theories from a broad range of disciplines and translating them into concrete tools for the use of social work professionals. They described her teaching and lecturing style as “unpedantic,” and many of her former students went on to fruitful careers. Dr. Sarvis and Marianne Pennekamp authored a book about their experiences in the Oakland schools. Berkeley colleague Robert A. Wasser, a Lecturer and Field Work Consultant at the School of Social Welfare, tested the manuscript with his students to provide feedback.[10] In addition to teaching in the School of Social Welfare, Dr. Sarvis also worked at Cowell Memorial Hospital on the Berkeley campus, first as a physician and later as a consultant to the psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers staffing the Student Health Services. Private Practice[edit] Dr. Sarvis entered private practice in 1955, locating her offices at 2811 College Ave., Berkeley.[11] Tending to focus on multivariable causation, Dr. Sarvis’s diagnoses were ahead of their time, and casework from her private practice led to several groundbreaking discoveries. Dr. Sarvis was among the first to examine temporal lobe damage as one of the factor in developmental disorders, including autism and paranoid attitudes. She added psychoanalytic services to her practice after completing analytic training with the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Society in 1955 and the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1959.[12] Permanente Psychiatric Clinic[edit] Mary Sarvis helped increase accessibility to institutionalized psychiatric services. Along with psychiatrist Harvey Powelson and psychologists Mervin B. Friedman and Timothy Leary, she planned the Permanente Psychiatric Clinic, which later became a part of the Kaiser Health Plan. The clinic offered psychiatric services covered by medical insurance. Leary, who later became famous for his experiments with psilocybin, envisioned the clinic as a sort of “psychlotron” for identifying and diagnosing elements of personality. He theorized that a controlled environment would allow clinicians to accelerate the human personality until it fractured into component parts.[13] He used data from the clinic to develop his theory on the interpersonal dimensions of personality, published in 1956. In the Introduction, Leary thanked Dr. Sarvis for lending “her diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge to the research group with unsparing generosity.” Dr. Sarvis also appears as an authority on child personality in the text, associated with the ideas that parents can differ in their opinions of a child and that personality traits found in the grandparents can skip a generation to reappear in their grandchildren.[14] Stephen Rauch, another Permanente Clinic psychologist, also collaborated with Mary Sarvis on a research study. Published posthumously in 1966, their paper continued Dr. Sarvis’ investigations into temporal lobe damage, reporting a case where damage was only discovered after considerable treatment.[15] Associations[edit] Dr. Sarvis identified with a number of professional associations and non-profit organizations. She was a member of the American Psychological Association, American Psychoanalytic Association, the American Medical Association, and the East Bay and Northern California Psychiatric Societies. Additionally, she partnered with several organizations involved in the mental health of children. Dr. Sarvis served as director of the Ann Martin Foundation, a non-profit first established in Oakland in 1963 using funds left by Dr. Ann Martin, founder of the Child Development Center at Children’s Hospital. The Ann Martin Foundation continues to operate to this day under the aegis of the Ann Martin Center and provides psychological and educational services to children and families.[16] Similarly, she served as consultant for the staff of the Parent-Child Counseling Center in Orinda, founded in 1961. At the time of her death, Dr. Sarvis was director of the Oakland Youth Employment Project. Previously, she served on the city’s Mayor’s Committee for Civic Unity. In addition to the aforementioned Ann Martin Foundation, Dr. Sarvis’ obituary requested that memorial contributions go to the American Civil Liberties Union or the American Friends Service Committee, suggesting her membership in those organizations. According to her sister Betty Luse, Dr. Sarvis enjoyed hiking with the Sierra Club. Publications[edit] Dr. Sarvis published a number of single and co-authored works in a variety of fields including psychoanalysis and guidance. Her works were well received by colleagues. A selected bibliography is included below. Year Publication Description 1954 “Unique Functions of Public School Guidance Programs,” Mental Hygiene 38:2, pp. 285–298. Dr. Sarvis encourages that a distinction be made between “transferrable” and “non-transferrable” services. Transferrable services can be acquired elsewhere, but non-transferrable services are those unique to a particular organization. When agencies consider which services to offer clients, they should prioritize non-transferrable services. 1959 “A Concept of Ego-Oriented Psychotherapy.” Coauthored with Ruth Johnson and Sally De Wees. Psychiatry: Journal for Study of Interpersonal Processes, 22: pp. 277–87 Called brief and focused intervention, particularly in times of stress. As with Collaboration in School Guidance, the work emphasized “the useful next step.” 1960 “Psychiatric Implications of Temporal Lobe Damage.” Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, 15: pp. 454–481. Dr. Sarvis’ study of the effects of minor temporal lobe damage on children’s psychiatry created quite a bit of interest. This study profoundly affected her continued research and cemented her devotion to interdisciplinary study. 1961 “Etiological Variables in Autism.” Co-authored with Blanche Garcia. Psychiatry, 24: pp. 307–17, Sarvis and Garcia advanced that autism is a multiple-origin disorder. Based on direct observations of children in a therapeutic nursery school, their study identified minimal cerebral dysfunction as a cause factor for autism, but also fell into contemporary thinking that linked autism with distant, cold and vindictive parents (especially mothers), a popular psychoanalytic perspective. 1962 “Paranoid Reactions: Perceptual Distortion as an Etiological Agent.” Archives of General Psychiatry, 6:2, pp. 157–162 In this paper, Dr. Sarvis continued her research on temporal lobe disturbance, directing psychiatrists to look for damage when treating patients exhibiting paranoid behavior. 1966 “Longitudinal Study of a Patient with Premature Ego Development.” Coauthored with Stephen Rauch, Ph.D. Journal of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry, 5:1, pp. 46–65 Dr. Sarvis’ extended case study identified temporal lobe damage as a cause for psychiatric disorder only after a significant passage of time. 1970 Collaboration in School Guidance. Coauthored with Marianne Pennekamp (Bruner / Mazel). Pennekamp and Sarvis addressed how principals, teachers, mental health and social services experts (both outside and within the school), and the community needed to work together to help children create a plan that would help them function within the classroom and beyond. The mentality was towards adaptive problem-solving, through structured tasks aimed at making “the next useful step.” Vignettes from many Bay Area guidance workers fleshed out the theory in action in various situations, including particularly poor neighborhoods, severely disturbed children, and the secondary school level. Legacy[edit] Mary Sarvis Foundation[edit] Following Dr. Sarvis’ unexpected death, original publisher Basic Books suspended the contract for Sarvis and Pennekamp’s Collaboration in School Guidance. Friends stepped up to remember Sarvis by carrying on her unfinished work. Their agenda included securing a publisher for Collaboration in School Guidance, as well as issuing small grants to young people who were not served by established channels of aid. The Mary Sarvis Memorial Fund began in 1965, and was officially incorporated in 1966. The original Board of Directors included Blanche Garcia (President), Irving Berg, M.D. (Vice-President), Kathleen D’Azevedo (Secretary), Beulah Parker, M.D. (Treasurer), and Janet McLeod, Henry Poppic, and Leland Vaughn. After successfully publishing Collaboration in School Guidance with Bruner/Mazel in 1970, the Mary Sarvis Memorial Fund continued its operations. At first, an annual memorial lecture supported their projects, but eventually, the organization transitioned to fundraising by means of a yearly cocktail party / potluck. The Mary Sarvis Memorial Fund (MSMF) continues to this day, issuing 70-80 small grants every year for amounts ranging from $0–$400.00 (most fall between $200 and $375). The grants are for diverse causes, the common theme being immediate projects that are not covered by existing programs but will make a significant difference in the life of a child. In developing and considering grant proposals, the MSMF encourages collaboration between children, families, and additional organizations to maximize impact, carrying on Mary Sarvis' legacy of "the next useful step." Some past grants include: A senior in high school in good academic standing with college ambition enrolled in a statistics class that required a special kind of calculator. MSMF paid for the calculator. A foster child was in the process of reuniting with her biological family. MSMF paid for a family bonding visit to Marine World. A 10-year-old girl in therapy for anxiety and social awkwardness feels "great" when doing gymnastics. MSMF paid for the gymnastics class. A foster mother's baby was born early. She needed a car seat to be able to take her baby home. MSMF paid for the car seat. A 2nd grade boy's glasses fell off while playing at recess. His lenses broke. The family partnered with the optometrist and MSMF to replace with lenses. The organization is based out of Piedmont, CA. References[edit] ^ Erikson, Erik Homburger (1995).

Pere Tresfort was a minor Catalan Occitan poet of the early fifteenth century. Three of his poems are preserved in the Cançoner Vega-Aguiló and from their rubrics it can be ascertained that Pere was a notary. His song "Ab fletxes d'aur untatz d'erb'amorosa" consists in one decasyllabic stanza and a tornada. This theme was revisited at greater length by Ausiàs March towards the end of the century. The dansa "Jovencelhs qui no à.ymia" is written in praise of love. Pere's third song is "Gran carrech han huy tuyt l'om de paratge". Sources[edit] Riquer, Martín de (1964).

(1911). "article name needed". Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.  Thembuland, Afrikaans: Temboeland, is a natural region in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Its territory is the traditional region of the Thembu people, one of the sub-groups of the Xhosa nation. It was formerly also known as "Tamboekieland" or "Tambookieland". The area of Thembuland proper includes present-day Mthatha, Mqanduli, Ngcobo, Mjanyana, Dutywa and Willowvale as well as their surroundings. Contents 1 Geography 2 History 2.1 Early history 2.2 Incorporation into the Cape Colony 2.3 Early political restrictions 2.4 The Union of South Africa and Apartheid history 2.5 Secession dispute 3 References Geography[edit] Thembuland was historically defined as the area between Umtata and the upper Kei River. As such it formed an area of 50 by 120 miles, although its boundary was considered disputable with Pondoland on the coast, and with Fingoland just to the south. The definition of the area has also changed over time. Before colonial conquest, it was divided into Tembuland Proper, Emigrant Tembuland and Bomvanaland —the Bomvana were a related people who lived on the east bank of the Bashee River, in what was later the district of Elliotdale. In colonial times it was defined as consisting of the districts of Emjanyana, Engcobo, Mqanduli, Umtata, St Marks, Southeyville and Xalanga. History[edit] Early history[edit] The hunter-gatherer San and Khoikhoi people had inhabited the region since Pre-historic times in scattered nomadic groups since circa 30,000 BC. In the 16th century, iron-working Nguni farmers entered the area from the north-east. A sub-group of the Nguni peoples became the Thembu people. Although originally classed as a separate Nguni nation, the Thembu subsequently assimilated to a large degree with the neighbouring Xhosa people. Thembuland was originally an independent kingdom, ruled by the Hala royal clan. British interference and incursions began in the 19th century. From 1871, the Thembu were engaged in a protracted war against an alliance of neighbouring Xhosa-speaking peoples, including the Pondo, the Bomvana and the Gcaleka. The Thembu Paramount-Chief, Ngangelizwe, had sought to unite the various Thembu clans but had come under increasing military pressure from Sarhili, Paramount-Chief of the Gcaleka. The conflict had a personal side, as Ngangelizwe's Chief Wife Novili was the daughter of Sarhili, and rumours had been spread that Ngangelizwe had ill-treated her. [1] Facing severe military pressure from the combined armies of his enemies, Chief Ngangelizwe and his Ministers approached the nominally-independent Cape Colony, to negotiate alliance and possible incorporation. Incorporation into the Cape Colony[edit] The Cape Colony, having recently achieved a degree of independence from Britain under the system of Responsible Government, operated under a relatively inclusive system of multi-racial franchise - whereby qualifications for suffrage applied equally to all male residents, regardless of race. Its laws also forbade any white settlement in traditional "Native territory". The Cape was therefore viewed by Ngangelizwe and his ministers as a satisfactory entity to merge with.[2][3] Ngangelizwe however, was a highly controversial leader in the Xhosa-speaking community. He was hated by many in the neighbouring Pondo and Gcaleka states, and accused of a range of crimes. The Cape Government demanded his resignation, as a precondition for any annexation.[4] According to Cape Parliamentary records, the Thembu leaders demanded, among other things, 4 magistracies with equal access to the Cape's current system of nonracial franchise, and military protection from both the British and their Gcaleka enemies. If these conditions were incorporated into law, together with respect for the traditional authority of the chiefs, then they would request incorporation.[5] Cape Prime Minister John Molteno agreed to these terms and signed them into law with the Tembuland Annexation Act (1876), creating the magisterial districts of Xalanga, St. Marks, Elliot and Engcobo.[6][7] The resignation of the controversial Thembu King Ngangelizwe had initially been demanded by the Cape government as a precondition for annexation, but this condition was waived as being impractical. Otherwise, the terms of the incorporation were implemented as stated. Traditional land ownership was fully recognised and, with the exception of a few missionaries and white traders, Thembuland was preserved for Thembu occupation, as part of the "Transkeian territories". However, the British overthrow of the elected Cape government in 1878 and assumption of direct rule over the Cape Colony caused the Confederation Wars, and the later disruption of the treaty's peaceful implementation. The annexation was only finally completed in 1885. Thembuland was defined at the time as being the territory between Umtata and the Tsomo River, and home to 60,000 people. Thembuland also submitted troops to the Frontier Armed forces of the Cape Colony, who, in this capacity, fought several victorious campaigns against their Gcaleka and Mpondo enemies. Early political restrictions[edit] Main article: Cape Qualified Franchise § Erosion and abolition According to the original laws of the Cape Colony, as well as the terms of the Annexation Act, Europeans were prohibited from owning land in the Thembu territories. This was initially intended to prevent the dispossession of the Thembu by aggressive settlers, however in the ensuing political upheavals, the law was badly enforced. From the 1880s, the pro-imperialist governments of Prime Ministers John Gordon Sprigg and Cecil Rhodes turned a blind eye to white incursions. Already by 1882, white settlers had illegally moved north of the Great Kei River and, in the same year, Chief Ngangelizwe himself sold territory within Umtata district to white land owners. In 1894, the Glen Gray Act constituted the Thembu chiefs as leaders of "District Councils", thereby establishing a system of proxy rulers. The Government of Cecil Rhodes passed legislation, such as the Parliamentary Registration Act, that severely curtailed the voting rights of the Thembu and all Black African citizens of the Cape. However it was the Union of South Africa, in the Twentieth Century, that was to oversee the greatest growth in oppression against the people of Thembuland. The Union of South Africa and Apartheid history[edit] Later, in the lead up to the Union of South Africa and the beginning of Apartheid, the franchise and property rights of the Thembu were gradually revoked, and what rights remained were applied only in their original homeland. Later still, under apartheid, the Transkei was turned into a bantustan. In the ethnic theory underpinning apartheid, the Transkei was regarded as the "homeland" of the Xhosa people. As a result, the Thembu people are often misidentified as being Xhosa.[8][not in citation given] Secession dispute[edit] The current Thembu king is King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, son of Sabata Jonguhlanga Dalindyebo, and his praise name is Zwelibanzi. The King caused controversy in 2009, by calling for secession from South Africa, as a response to a criminal case against him. In December 2009 King Buyelekhaya was convicted of offences including culpable homicide, kidnapping, arson and assault. In response he proposed secession from South Africa[9][10] and later demanded that the South African government pay the king R900m and the tribe a further R80bn in compensation for the humiliation caused by the criminal trial.[11] Dalindyebo was imprisoned in December 2015, has since been customarily dethroned, and is expected to be administratively dethroned in the near future.[12] References[edit] ^ "Custom and the politics of sovereignty in South Africa - page 4 | Journal of Social History".

It was originally a wing of the Fulton Market, established in 1822 to sell a variety of foodstuffs and produce. In November 2005, the Fish Market relocated to a new facility in Hunts Point in the Bronx, from its historic location near the Brooklyn Bridge along the East River waterfront at and above Fulton Street in the Financial District, Lower Manhattan. During much of its 193-year tenure at the original site, the Fulton Fish Market was the most important wholesale East Coast fish market in the United States. Opened in 1822, it was the destination of fishing boats from across the Atlantic Ocean. By the 1950s, most of the Market's fish were trucked in rather than offloaded from the docks. The wholesalers at the Market then sold it to restaurateurs and retailers who purchased fresh fish of every imaginable variety.[1] It was possible for fish to be rushed from fishing ports in New England to wholesale buyers at the Fulton Fish Market, who might then resell it to retail markets and restaurants in the very same towns where the catch originated. Prices at the Fulton Fish Market were tracked and reported by the United States government. In its original location, it was one of the last, and most significant, of the great wholesale food markets of New York. It survived major fires in 1835, 1845, 1918, and 1995. In its new location in the Hunts Point Cooperative Market, it handles millions of pounds of seafood daily, with annual sales exceeding one billion dollars, and is second in size worldwide after Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish market.[2] Contents 1 History 1.1 Nineteenth century 1.2 Organized crime 1.3 New Bronx facility 2 Media references 2.1 Music 2.2 Television 3 References 4 External links History[edit] Nineteenth century[edit] Former market building, now a restaurant The Fulton Fish Market was one of New York's earliest open-air fish markets. From a New York newspaper dated 1831: In New York, there are a number of Markets. Those called Fulton and Washington Markets are the largest. Fulton Market is at the East end of Fulton Street near the East River...The first was formerly situated in Maiden Lane on the East River side, and was called Fly Market. The Fulton Fish Market is one of the oldest fish markets in the United States, in competition with the smaller Maine Avenue Fish Market in Washington, D.C. The Fulton Market was claimed to be the oldest in continuous operation in one place (since 1822) until it was relocated in 2005. The Maine Avenue Market in D.C. (since 1805, in various incarnations) is now considered the oldest continuously operating open-air market that still survives on the East Coast. However, the Fulton Fish Market is the oldest institution that still retains a primarily wholesale function; although its original public market on South Street is now closed. Organized crime[edit] During most of the 20th century the market was associated with one or more New York Mafia families. In 1988, the U.S. Attorney's Office filed a suit under federal racketeering laws to appoint a trustee to run the market.[3] A trustee was appointed, but the extent to which he was able to limit organized crime influence was limited.[4] Since 2001, the market has been regulated by the City of New York's Business Integrity Commission in an effort to eliminate organized crime influence.[5] New Bronx facility[edit] Entrance gate On November 14, 2005, nearly 4 years after construction on the $85 million facility began, the Market opened at its Bronx location. The move had been delayed due to legal problems.[6] The last-minute dispute was between a company which had had a ten-year monopoly on delivering fish from trucks to individual sellers' stalls, versus the cooperative of sellers who wanted to do the task themselves in the new building. When the feuding parties agreed to continue as they had been for another three years, the last obstacle to the move was removed and packing began.[7] The move from the historic Manhattan site was due to a number of factors:[8][9][10][11][12] cramped location lack of modern amenities, such as climate control increasing real estate value of Manhattan site for retail and residential use redevelopment pressure due to desirable proximity to the South Street Seaport and the Fulton Street/East River area The move brought 650 workers from the market's former location into the Bronx,[13] with an additional 5500 diesel truck trips through Hunts Point per week (according to the NY Metropolitan Transportation Council[14] – bringing the weekly total to 60,000.[15] The facility generates over $1 billion in yearly revenue, and allows seafood distributors to store their goods in temperature controlled warehouses with easier transportation access due to its proximity to the Bruckner Expressway. The 400,000-square-foot (37,000 m2) facility has better access to major highways in Hunts Point, but doesn't utilize the nearby LaGuardia Airport in Queens.[16] In 2012, the market handled 200,000,000 pounds (91,000,000 kg) of fish annually, at an estimated value of $1 billion.[17] Media references[edit] Music[edit] The song "What a Waste" from the musical Wonderful Town (1953) describes a "kid from Cape Cod" who came to New York City to join the opera: "Sing Rigoletto his wish. At the Fulton Market now he yells 'fish!'"[citation needed] The Fulton Fish Market is referred to tacitly in P. D. Q. Bach's Iphigenia in Brooklyn: "And lo, she found herself within a market. And all around her, fish were dying. And yet their stench did live on."[citation needed] The Fulton Fish Market is referenced in the Steve Earle song "Down Here Below".[citation needed] The 33 LP Album by James Late called Fulton Fish Market . Television[edit] As a follow-up to the trio of BBC2 documentaries entitled The London Markets, the fish merchant Roger Barton appears as the central figure in a further series of documentaries entitled World's Greatest Food Markets. These were broadcast in the UK, Autumn 2014. In the first episode he competes commercially with his Bronx contemporaries in the New Fulton Fish Market.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ Ackman, Dan (July 2, 2000). "The Big Man in Shrimp".

He crashes but manages to pass through the "wall of illusion" and is found and brought back to health by the Enlightened Elders. They have chosen him to lead their fight against the evil Omega, an Orwellian state run by the evil Prossor. The Elders are allied with the resistance movement, the Outsiders. The Rider first helps Nastasia and the other Outsiders by rescuing McWayne, Nastasia's father and leader of the Outsiders. While the Rider and McWayne successfully escape, Nastasia is captured and subjected to brainwashing by Prossor. The Rider gains acceptance from various Marginals (amazons, martial artists, truckers, punks, soldiers, Omega defectors) by winning in the ritual brawl which determines who is the strongest. The Rider and the Outsiders launch their final attack on Prossor's regime, but are intercepted by the Omegas and a giant armored truck, called Megaweapon. As the rebels destroy the Omega patrols with their cars (Ford Taunus TCs), helicopters and tankers, the Rider manages to destroy the Megaweapon by short circuiting it, but not before his speedcycle is crushed under the truck's wheels. The Rider and McWayne storm Prossor's headquarters where they face the dictator and a brainwashed Nastasia. She wounds the Rider, but when ordered to kill her father, she rebels, turning on Prossor and shooting him instead. The Omega has been overthrown, and the Outsiders and Marginals celebrate, as the Rider prepares to move on with his repaired speedcycle. In a twist, it is revealed that the man Nastasia shot was actually a cyborg clone and the real Prossor is still alive. He flies away with an unnamed traitor of the New Way (Fred Williamson), plotting revenge against the "animals" that defeated him. Mystery Science Theater 3000[edit] Warrior of the Lost World featured in the first episode of the fifth season of Mystery Science Theater 3000. A recurring joke is that the crew can't remember the lead actor Robert Ginty's name, referring to him as "the Paper Chase guy." The crew also find the voice of the speedcycle's display screen so irritating that they cheer when it is destroyed by Megaweapon, referring to Megaweapon onwards as "the only good thing in this movie" and even giving Megaweapon a phone call after watching the film.[citation needed] The MST3K version of the film was released on DVD by Shout! Factory in December 2009 as part of the "Volume XVI" box set. The DVD includes an interview with director David Worth, who discussed the making of the film (his directorial debut). Worth previously appeared at the first ConventioCon ExpoFest-A-Rama in 1994, and describes himself as a fan of the show.[citation needed] References[edit] External links[edit] Warrior of the Lost World at the Internet Movie Database Warrior of the Lost World at AllMovie

He was Republican Party (GOP) House Majority Leader from 2003–05. DeLay began his career as a politician in 1978 when he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives. In 1985, he became a born-again Christian. In 1988, after just a few years in the U.S. House, Tom DeLay was appointed Deputy Minority Whip. In 1994 he helped Newt Gingrich effect the Republican Revolution, which gave the Republicans the victory in the 1994 midterm election and swept Democrats from power in both houses of Congress, putting Republicans in control of the House of Representatives for the first time in forty years. In 1995, he was elected House Majority Whip. With the Republicans in control of both chambers in Congress, DeLay, along with Gingrich and conservative activist Grover Norquist, helped start the K Street Project, an effort to advance Republican ideals. DeLay was elected House Majority Leader after the 2002 midterm elections. On policy issues, DeLay was known as a strong conservative during his years in Congress. In 2005, DeLay was indicted on criminal charges of conspiracy to violate election law in 2002 by a Travis County grand jury after having waived his rights under the statutes of limitations. In accordance with Republican Caucus rules, DeLay temporarily resigned from his position as House Majority Leader, and later, after pressure from fellow Republicans, announced that he would not seek to return to the position. He was convicted in January 2011 and sentenced to three years in prison but was free on bail while appealing his conviction. The trial court's judgment was overturned by the Texas Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court, on September 19, 2013, with a ruling that "the evidence in the case was 'legally insufficient to sustain DeLay's convictions'", and DeLay was formally acquitted.[1] The State of Texas appealed the acquittal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals[2][3] On October 1, 2014, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the appellate court decision overturning DeLay's conviction.[4] After leaving Congress, DeLay co-authored, with Stephen Mansfield, a political memoir, No Retreat, No Surrender: One American's Fight.

He attended Baylor University for two years, majoring in pre-med, but was expelled for drinking and painting Baylor school colors on a building at rival Texas A&M University.[8] The Washington Post reported that DeLay obtained student deferments from military service while in college and that he received a high draft lottery number in 1969 which ensured that he would not be drafted for the Vietnam War. DeLay graduated from the University of Houston in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science in biology.[8] Personal life[edit] DeLay married Christine Furrh, whom he had known since high school, in 1967. In 1972, the DeLays had a daughter, Danielle, who is now a public school math teacher. During his time in the Texas Legislature, DeLay struggled with alcoholism and gained a reputation as a playboy, earning the nickname "Hot Tub Tom". By the time of his election to Congress in 1984 he was drinking "eight, ten, twelve martinis a night at receptions and fundraisers."[9] In 1985 DeLay became a born-again Christian, and gave up hard liquor. Of the Rev. Ken Wilde, an evangelical minister from Idaho who founded the National Prayer Center in Washington, D.C., which houses volunteers who come to the capital to pray for the nation's leaders, DeLay said, "This is the man who really saved me. When I was going through my troubles, it was Ken who really stepped up." Of his conversion, DeLay said, "I had put my needs first ... I was on the throne, not God. I had pushed God from His throne." In criticizing Newt Gingrich for secretly having an affair with a staffer while Gingrich, as House Speaker, was simultaneously impeaching President Bill Clinton for lying under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, DeLay said, "I don't think that Newt could set a high moral standard, a high moral tone, during that moment.... You can’t do that if you're keeping secrets about your own adulterous affairs." Differentiating between Gingrich's adultery and his own admitted adultery, DeLay said, "I was no longer committing adultery by that time, the impeachment trial. There's a big difference. ... I had returned to Christ and repented my sins by that time."[10] DeLay declined to comment on a 1999 report in The New Yorker that he was estranged from much of his family, including his mother and one of his brothers.[11] As of 2001, DeLay had not spoken to his younger brother, Randy, a Houston lobbyist, since 1996, when a complaint to the House Ethics Committee prompted DeLay to state that he had cut his brother off in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.[9] In 1994, Christine DeLay began volunteering as a court-appointed special advocate for abused and neglected children in foster care, and soon thereafter, the DeLays became foster parents to three teenage boys. In 2005, Christine and Tom DeLay founded Rio Bend, a "Christ-centered" foster care community in Richmond, Texas,[12] that cares for abused and neglected children "as an answer to problems they felt plagued the current foster care system", according to the Rio Bend website, which continues, "The DeLays developed Rio Bend’s vision based on Christine's time spent as a special advocate, as well as their experiences together as therapeutic foster parents."[12] Early private sector career[edit] After graduating from college, DeLay spent three years at pesticide-maker Redwood Chemical[8] and then purchased Albo Pest Control, which DeLay grew into a large and successful business. This work was the source for his nickname, "the Exterminator". In the 11 years DeLay ran the company, the Internal Revenue Service imposed three tax liens on him for failure to pay payroll and income taxes.[9] The United States Environmental Protection Agency's ban on Mirex, a pesticide that was used in extermination work, led DeLay to oppose government regulation of businesses, a belief that he has carried with him throughout his political career.[13] Political career[edit] President Bush signing the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. DeLay is shown in the upper right of the photograph. Local politics[edit] In 1978, DeLay won the election for an open seat in the Texas House of Representatives. He was the first Republican to represent Fort Bend County in the state House. DeLay ran for Congress in 1984 from the 22nd District, after fellow Republican Ron Paul decided to run in the Republican primary for the 1984 U.S. Senate race instead of for reelection (Paul subsequently returned to Congress from a neighboring district). He easily won a crowded six-way primary with 53 percent of the vote, and cruised to election in November. DeLay was one of six freshmen Republican congressmen elected from Texas in 1984 known as the Texas Six Pack. He was reelected 10 times, never facing substantive opposition in what had become a solidly Republican district.[citation needed] Early Congressional career[edit] As a member of the Republican minority in the 1980s, DeLay made a name for himself by criticizing the National Endowment for the Arts and the Environmental Protection Agency. During his first term in Congress, DeLay was appointed to the Republican Committee on Committees, which assigned representatives to House committees, and in his second term, he was appointed to the powerful House Appropriations Committee, a position that he retained until his election as Majority Leader in 2003. He was reappointed to the committee in 2006 after leaving his position as Majority Leader. He also served for a time as chairman of a group of conservative House Republicans known as the Republican Study Committee, and as Secretary of the House Republican Conference. DeLay was appointed as a deputy Republican whip in 1988.[citation needed] Majority Whip[edit] When the Republican Party gained control of the House in 1995 following the 1994 election, or "Republican Revolution", DeLay was elected Majority Whip against the wishes of House Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich. DeLay was not always on good terms with Gingrich or Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader from 1995 to 2003, and he reportedly considered them uncommitted to Christian values. Nevertheless, in the heyday of the 104th Congress (1995–1997), DeLay described the Republican leadership as a triumvirate of Gingrich, "the visionary"; Armey, "the policy wonk"; and himself, "the ditch digger who makes it all happen".[14] In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw Speaker Newt Gingrich's public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman John Boehner of Ohio and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.[15] On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as the only member of the leadership who had been appointed to his position—by Gingrich—instead of elected.[16] As Majority Whip, DeLay earned the nickname "The Hammer" for his enforcement of party discipline in close votes and his reputation for wreaking political vengeance on opponents. DeLay has expressed a liking for his nickname, pointing out that the hammer is one of a carpenter's most valuable tools.[17] In the 104th Congress, DeLay successfully whipped 300 out of 303 bills.[18] In 1998, DeLay worked to ensure that the House vote on impeaching President Bill Clinton was successful.[9] DeLay rejected efforts to censure Clinton, who, DeLay said, had lied under oath.[19] DeLay posited that the U.S. Constitution allowed the House to punish the president only through impeachment. He called on Clinton to resign and personally compelled enough House members to vote to approve two articles of impeachment.[19][20] Republicans paid the price at the polls during the 1998 congressional "midterm" election, as the GOP sustained a net loss of five seats to Democrats in the House of Representatives. Newt Gingrich, whose approval as Speaker, both in the Congress and in the public eye, had already greatly suffered due to his polarizing political style and a formal House reprimand and $300,000 fine for political ethics violations, was widely blamed for the political failure of impeachment and the House losses by Republicans in the 1998 midterms and during the 1996 general election as well. Facing the second major attempt in as many years by House Republicans, including DeLay, to oust him as Speaker, Gingrich announced he would resign from Congress. Following Gingrich's announcement, Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston of Louisiana became the presumptive Speaker-elect until December 1998, when, during House debate over its still-ongoing impeachment proceedings, he admitted to extramarital affairs himself and withdrew his name from consideration as Speaker. Armey was out of the running after fending off a bruising challenge to his majority leader's post from Steve Largent of Oklahoma, and DeLay, as the third-ranking House Republican, appeared to have the inside track to the Speakership. However DeLay decided that he would be "too nuclear" to lead the closely divided House that had resulted from the Republican House losses in 1996 and 1998. So instead DeLay proposed his chief vote-counter, Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert, as a compromise candidate, since Hastert had very good relations on both sides of the aisle. As Congress reconvened in January 1999, Hastert was elected House Speaker, and DeLay was reelected House Majority Whip.[21] Majority Leader[edit] After serving as his party's Whip for eight years, DeLay was elected Majority Leader upon the retirement of Dick Armey in 2003. His tenure as Majority Leader was marked by strong Republican party discipline and by parliamentary and redistricting efforts to preserve Republican control of the House. After his indictment on September 28, 2005, DeLay stepped down from his position as Majority Leader. He was the first congressional leader ever to be indicted.[22] Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri took over as acting leader.[23] On January 7, 2006, after weeks of growing pressure from Republican colleagues, and particularly from Reps. Charlie Bass and Jeff Flake,[24] who wanted to avoid being associated with DeLay's legal issues in an election year, DeLay announced he would not seek to regain his position as Majority Leader. Legislative and electoral methods[edit] DeLay was known to "primary" Republicans who resisted his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative),[25] and, like many of his predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the rank-and-file members of the party. Employing a method known as "catch and release", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips from both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, respectively, when in power.[citation needed] In the 108th Congress, a preliminary Medicare vote passed 216–215, a vote on Head Start passed 217–216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209-208, and "Fast track", usually called "trade promotion authority", passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as "growing the vote". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills. One lobbyist said, "I've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill—at least like they are asking us to whip bills now."[26] His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total.[27] Partly as a result of DeLay's management abilities, the House Republican caucus under him displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion.[28] On September 30, 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay because he "offered to endorse Representative [Nick] Smith's son in exchange for Representative Smith's vote in favor of the Medicare bill."[29] Controversies[edit] Campaign finance activities[edit] Main article: Tom DeLay campaign finance trial Following petition drives by citizens and organizations asking that DeLay be removed from office[30] and official admonishments by the United States House Committee on Ethics,[31] DeLay was charged in 2005 with money laundering and conspiracy charges related to illegal campaign finance activities aimed at helping Republican candidates for Texas state office in the 2002 elections. The indictment was sought by Ronnie Earle, the Democratic former District Attorney of Travis County (which includes the state capital of Austin). A first grand jury rejected Earle's indictment attempt, but a second grand jury issued an indictment for one count of criminal conspiracy on September 28, 2005. On October 3, a third grand jury indicted DeLay for the more serious offense of money laundering.[32] An arrest warrant was issued on October 19, 2005, and DeLay turned himself in the next day to the Harris County Sheriff's Office in Houston.[33] In accordance with House Republican Conference rules, DeLay temporarily resigned from his position as House Majority Leader. On January 7, 2006, after pressure from fellow Republicans, he announced that he would not seek to return to the post. On June 9, 2006, he resigned from Congress.[34] After two judges recused themselves, the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court assigned Senior District Judge Pat Priest, a San Antonio Democrat, to preside over the trial.[35] DeLay moved to dismiss all charges. Judge Priest dismissed one count of the indictment alleging conspiracy to violate election law but allowed the other, more serious charges of money laundering and conspiracy to engage in money laundering to proceed. He also refused to allow a change of venue from Travis County, which the defense argued could not be the site of an impartial trial, to Fort Bend County, in which DeLay resided. The trial began on October 26, 2010, in Austin.[36] On November 24, 2010, DeLay was found guilty by a Travis County jury on both counts. The range of possible sentences was probation to between 5 and 99 years in prison and up to $20,000 in fines, though the judge could have chosen probation.[37] On January 10, 2011, after a sentencing hearing, the judge sentenced DeLay to three years in prison on the charge of conspiring to launder corporate money into political donations. On the charge of money laundering, he was sentenced to five years in prison, but that was probated for 10 years, meaning DeLay would serve 10 years' probation. Dick DeGuerin is DeLay's defense attorney. DeLay appealed his conviction to the Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District at Austin, which heard oral arguments on October 10, 2012.[38] On September 19, 2013, a ruling by the Court of Appeals overturned his convictions and entered an acquittal. Justice Melissa Goodwin, a Republican, wrote in the majority opinion that Rather than supporting an agreement to violate the election code, the evidence shows that the defendants were attempting to comply with the Election Code limitations on corporate contributions. She was joined in the opinion by visiting Justice David Galtney, also a Republican. Chief Justice J. Woodfin Jones, a Democrat, dissented, writing, "I disagree with the majority's conclusion that there was legally insufficient evidence to support a jury finding that the corporate contributions at issue here were the proceeds of criminal activity." The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted the prosecution's petition for discretionary review on March 19, 2013, agreeing to review the decision of the Texas Court of Appeals Third District.[39][40][41] In an 8–1 decision, DeLay's acquittal became final on October 1, 2014. He has three years from that date to file any lawsuits for wrongful action.[42] Contributions from Russian oil executives[edit] In December 2005, the Washington Post reported that, in 1998, a group of Russian oil executives had given money to a nonprofit advocacy group run by a former DeLay staffer and funded by clients of lobbyist Jack Abramoff, in an attempt to influence DeLay's vote on an International Monetary Fund bailout of the Russian economy.[43] Associates of DeLay adviser Ed Buckham, the founder of the U.S. Family Network, said that executives from the oil firm Naftasib had offered a donation of $1,000,000 to be delivered to a Washington, D.C.-area airport to secure DeLay's support. On June 25, 1998, the U.S. Family Network received a $1 million check via money transferred through the London law firm James & Sarch Co. This payment was the largest single entry on U.S. Family Network's donor list. The original source of the donation was not recorded.[44] DeLay denied the payment had influenced his vote. Naftasib denied it had made the payment and that it had ever been represented by James & Sarch Co. The now-dissolved law firm's former partners declined to comment due to "confidentiality requirements".[citation needed] The K Street Project[edit] See also: K Street Project DeLay's involvement with the lobbying industry included a pointed effort on the part of the Republican Party to parlay the Congressional majority into dominance of K Street, the lobbying district of Washington, D.C. DeLay, Senator Rick Santorum, and Grover Norquist launched a campaign in 1995 encouraging lobbying firms to retain only Republican officials in top positions. Firms that had Democrats in positions of authority, DeLay suggested, would not be granted the ear of majority party members. In 1999, DeLay was privately reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee after he pulled an intellectual property rights bill off the House floor when the Electronics Industries Alliance hired a former Democratic Congressman, Dave McCurdy.[45] Firms initially responded to the campaign, but it waned during 2004, when the possibility of Senator John Kerry's winning the presidency gave lobbying firms some incentive to hire Democrats.[46] Cuban cigar photo[edit] DeLay has long been a strong critic of Cuban leader Fidel Castro's regime, which DeLay has called a "thugocracy", and a supporter of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. However, in April 2005, Time Magazine published a photo from a government-funded July 2003 trip to Israel, in which DeLay is seen smoking a Cuban cigar.[47] The consumption or purchase of Cuban cigars is illegal in the United States (but was, at the time, legal for U.S. citizens abroad). Since September 2004, the U.S. Treasury Department's enforcement of the law has been toughened to forbid consumption (smoking) or purchase of Cuban cigars by U.S. citizens anywhere in the world.[48] Misuse of federal investigative agencies[edit] During the Texas redistricting warrant controversy, several Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives went to Oklahoma to prevent the House from establishing a quorum of members, thereby preventing the House from acting on any legislation, including a proposed redistricting plan. Although not a member of the Texas legislature, DeLay became involved, by contacting several federal agencies in order to determine the location of the missing legislators. DeLay's staff contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for assistance in tracking down a plane that one of the legislators was flying to Oklahoma, an action that the FAA believed to be a result of safety concerns about the aircraft.[49] A review by the U.S. Department of Transportation found that a total of thirteen FAA employees spent more than eight hours searching for the airplane.[50] Members of DeLay's staff asked the FBI to arrest the missing Democrats but a Justice Department official dismissed DeLay's and his staff's request as "wacko".[49] DeLay also contacted United States Marshal and United States Attorney's offices in Texas, as well as the Air and Marine Interdiction Coordination Center, an agency that deals with smuggling and terrorism.[51] U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman (I-Connecticut) requested an investigation into DeLay's involvement in the requests, and asked that any White House involvement be reported. The House Ethics Committee admonished DeLay for improper use of FAA resources, and for involving federal agencies in a matter that should have been resolved by Texas authorities.[52] Terri Schiavo[edit] See also: Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case DeLay called the Terri Schiavo case "one of my proudest moments in Congress".[10] DeLay made headlines for his role in helping lead federal intervention in the matter. On Palm Sunday weekend in March 2005, several days after the brain-damaged Florida woman's feeding tube was disconnected for the third time, the House met in emergency session to pass a bill allowing Schiavo's parents to petition a federal judge to review the removal of the feeding tube. DeLay called the removal of the feeding tube "an act of barbarism". DeLay faced accusations of hypocrisy from critics when the Los Angeles Times revealed that he had consented to ending life support for his father, who had been in a comatose state because of a debilitating accident in 1988.[53] DeLay was accused of endorsing violence in the wake of a series of high-profile violent crimes and death threats against judges when he said, "The men responsible [for Terri Schiavo's death] will have to answer to their behavior". DeLay's comments came soon after the February 28, 2005, homicide of the mother and husband of Chicago Judge Joan Lefkow, and the March 11, 2005, killing of Atlanta Judge Rowland Barnes. DeLay's opponents accused him of rationalizing violence against judges when their decisions were unpopular with the public. Ralph Neas, President of People for the American Way, said that DeLay's comments were "irresponsible and could be seen by some as justifying inexcusable conduct against our courts".[54] Settlement in civil suit[edit] In early 1999, The New Republic picked up a story, first reported by Houston-area alternative weeklies, alleging that DeLay had committed perjury during a civil lawsuit brought against him by a former business partner in 1994.[55] The plaintiff in that suit, Robert Blankenship, charged that DeLay and a third partner in Albo Pest Control had breached the partnership agreement by trying to force him out of the business without buying him out. Blankenship filed suit, charging DeLay and the other partner with breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, wrongful termination, and loss of corporate expectancy. While being deposed in that suit, DeLay claimed that he did not think that he was an officer or director of Albo and that he believed that he had resigned two or three years previously.[56] However, his congressional disclosure forms, including one filed subsequent to the deposition, stated that he was either president or chairman of the company between 1985 and 1994. Blankenship also alleged that Albo money had been spent on DeLay's congressional campaigns, in violation of federal and state law. DeLay and Blankenship settled for an undisclosed sum. Blankenship's attorney said that had he known about the congressional disclosure forms, he would have referred the case to the Harris County district attorney's office for a perjury prosecution.[56] Jack Abramoff scandal[edit] See also: Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal DeLay was the target of the Justice Department investigation into Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff's actions. Abramoff allegedly provided DeLay with trips, gifts, and political donations in exchange for favors to Abramoff's lobbying clients, which included the government of the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Internet gambling services, and several Native American tribes.[57] Two of DeLay's former political aides, Tony Rudy and Michael Scanlon, as well as Abramoff himself, pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges relating to the investigation. Political columnist Robert Novak reported that Abramoff "has no derogatory information about former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and is not implicating him as part of his plea bargain with federal prosecutors."[58] According to ABC's 20/20 television program and NPR, Abramoff lobbied DeLay to stop legislation banning sex shops and sweatshops that forced employees to have abortions in the Northern Mariana Islands when Abramoff accompanied DeLay on a 1997 trip to the U.S. commonwealth.[59] While on the trip, DeLay promised not to put the bill on the legislative calendar.[60] In 2000, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a worker reform bill to extend the protection of U.S. labor and minimum-wage laws to the workers in the Northern Mariana Islands. DeLay, the House Republican Whip, stopped the House from considering the bill.[61] DeLay later blocked a fact-finding mission planned by Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-MI) by threatening him with the loss of his subcommittee chairmanship.[60] DeLay received gifts from Abramoff, including paid golfing holidays to Scotland, concert tickets, and the use of Abramoff's private skyboxes for fundraisers. In May 2000, ARMPAC received the free use of one of Abramoff's private skyboxes to host a political fundraiser. At the time, campaign finance laws did not require the use of the skybox, valued at several thousand dollars, to be disclosed or for Abramoff to be reimbursed for its use.[62] Later that month, the DeLays, Rudy, another aide, and Abramoff took a trip to London and Scotland. Abramoff paid for the airfare for the trip, and lobbyist Ed Buckham paid for expenses at a hotel at St. Andrews golf course in Scotland.[63] Abramoff was reimbursed by The National Center for Public Policy Research, the nonprofit organization that arranged the trip. On the day that the trip began, The National Center received large donations from two of Abramoff's clients, internet lottery service eLottery, Inc., and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Both organizations denied that they had intended to pay for DeLay's trip.[64] House rules forbid members to accept travel expenses from lobbyists, and require that members inquire into the sources of funds that nonprofits use to pay for trips. DeLay denied knowing that lobbyists had paid for travel expenses. In July 2000, DeLay voted against a bill that would have restricted Internet gambling. Both eLottery and the Choctaws opposed the bill.[64] Rudy, who was then DeLay's deputy chief of staff, doomed the bill by engineering a parliamentary maneuver that required a two-thirds majority vote, rather than a simple majority, for the bill to pass. Rudy's actions on behalf of Abramoff's clients during this time were mentioned in Abramoff's guilty plea in January 2006.[65] In January 2006, The Associated Press reported that in 2001, DeLay co-signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft calling for the closure of a casino owned by the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. Two weeks earlier, the Choctaws had donated $1,000 to DeLay's Texans for a Republican Majority PAC (TRMPAC). A DeLay spokesman denied that the donations had influenced DeLay's actions.[66] Currently, and at the time of the letter, casinos or other private gambling establishments are illegal in Texas, even on Indian reservations.[67] Scanlon, who became Abramoff's lobbying partner, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to conspiracy charges.[68] Abramoff pleaded guilty to fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy charges on January 3, 2006, and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation. His cooperation may have forced DeLay to abandon his efforts to return to his position as House Majority Leader,[65] a decision DeLay announced only a few days after Abramoff's plea bargain. Rudy pleaded guilty on March 31, 2006, to illegally acting on Abramoff's behalf in exchange for gifts.[69] Abramoff referred clients to Ed Buckham's Alexander Strategy Group (ASG), a lobbying firm. In addition, Abramoff clients gave more than $1.5 million to Buckham's U.S. Family Network, which then paid ASG more than $1 million.[70] From 1998–2002, ASG paid Christine DeLay a monthly salary averaging between $3,200 and $3,400. DeLay's attorney, Richard Cullen, initially said the payments were for telephone calls she made periodically to the offices of certain members of Congress seeking the names of their favorite charities, and that she then forwarded that information to Buckham, along with some information about those charities. In early June 2006, Cullen said the payments were also for general political consulting she provided to her husband. In all, Christine DeLay was paid about $115,000 directly by ASG, and got another $25,000 via money put into a retirement account by the firm.[71] Her work with ASG has been the subject of an inquiry by the Department of Justice.[57][72] In August 2010, the government ended a six-year investigation of his ties to Abramoff, according to DeLay's lead counsel in the matter, Richard Cullen. A state case continued in Texas.[73] Political positions[edit] Domestic policy[edit] DeLay was rated a 2.77 out of 100 by Progressive Punch, a leftist affiliation, for his votes regarding corporate subsidies, government checks on corporate power, human rights and civil liberties, labor rights and environmental policy.[74] On economic policy, DeLay was rated 95 out of 100 by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative anti-tax group, and 95 to 100 by the United States Chamber of Commerce, a pro-business lobby. He received the lowest possible score of 0% from the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest organization of labor unions.[75] On environmental policy, he earned ratings of zero from the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters. He has been a fervent critic of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which he has called the "Gestapo of government".[76] In the politics of guns, DeLay firmly came down on the side of gun owners rights, loosening gun control laws and opposing stricter controls. He received a grade of "A+" from the National Rifle Association (NRA), the nation's largest pro-gun rights lobby.[9][77] The American Civil Liberties Union measured that his voting history aligned with their civil liberties platform 0% of the time.[78] On the issue of immigration, DeLay received the highest possible score of 100% from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an organization that seeks to restrict immigration.[79] On the issue of abortion, DeLay is "pro-life".[9] In 2005, he voted 100% in line with the views of the National Right to Life Committee and 0% with the National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League.[80] In the 1990s, in keeping with his opposition to environmental regulation, DeLay criticized proposals to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which lead to the depletion of the ozone layer. In 1995, DeLay introduced a bill to revoke the CFC ban and to repeal provisions of the Clean Air Act dealing with stratospheric ozone, arguing that the science underlying the ban was debatable.[citation needed] DeLay opposes the teaching of evolution. After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, he entered into the Congressional Record a statement saying that shootings happened in part "because our school systems teach our children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized [sic] out of some primordial soup of mud."[81] In 2001, DeLay defied President George W. Bush when DeLay refused to increase the Earned Income Credit (EIC) tax credit during the congressional battle over Bush's tax cuts for people making between $10,500 and $26,625 a year; when reporters asked DeLay about what he would do about increasing the EIC, DeLay simply stated, "[It] ain't going to happen." When Bush's press secretary Ari Fleischer reiterated the president's desire for a low-income tax cut, DeLay retorted, "The last time I checked they [the executive branch] don't have a vote."[82] In 2003, DeLay blamed Senate Democrats and what he called "BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything) environmentalists" for blocking legislative solutions to problems such as the 2003 North America blackout.[83] DeLay maintained public silence on Houston's 2003 METRORail light rail initiative, though in the past, he had opposed expanding light rail to Houston. Public filings later showed that DeLay had his Americans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (ARMPAC) and his congressional campaign committee sent money to Texans for True Mobility, an organization that advocated against the initiative. The proposal passed by a slim margin.[84] Despite his earlier opposition, following the passage of the initiative, DeLay helped to obtain funding for the light rail program.[85] In 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay for his actions related to a 2002 energy bill. A Committee memo stated that DeLay "created the appearance that donors were being provided with special access to Representative DeLay regarding the then-pending energy legislation."[86] In 2005, DeLay, acting against the president's wishes, initiated the "safe harbor" provision for MTBE in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, together with Rep. Joe Barton.[87] This provision would have retroactively protected the makers of the gasoline additive from lawsuits; the provision was later dropped from the final bill. DeLay supported the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. Critics of the legislation argued that it unduly favored creditors over consumers, noting that the credit card industry spent millions of dollars lobbying in support of the act. The bill passed Congress.[88] Foreign policy[edit] DeLay has been a strong supporter of the State of Israel, saying, "The Republican leadership, especially that leadership in the House, has made pro-Israel policy a fundamental component of our foreign policy agenda and it drives the Democrat [sic] leadership crazy—because they just can't figure out why we do it!"[89] In a 2002 speech, DeLay promised to "use every tool at my disposal to ensure that the Republican Conference, and the House of Representatives, continues to preserve and strengthen America's alliance with the State of Israel."[90] On a 2003 trip to Israel, DeLay toured the nation and addressed members of the Knesset. His opposition to land concessions is so strong that Aryeh Eldad, the deputy of Israel's conservative National Union party, remarked, "As I shook his hand, I told Tom DeLay that until I heard him speak, I thought I was farthest to the right in the Knesset."[91] Former Mossad chief Danny Yatom said "The Likud is nothing compared to this guy."[92] In 2005, in a snub to the Bush administration, DeLay was the "driving force behind the rejection of direct aid" to the Palestinian Authority. The deal was "brokered" by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. In the wake of the legislation, some Jewish leaders expressed concern "about the degree to which the Texas Republican, an evangelical Christian who opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, will go to undercut American and Israeli attempts to achieve a two-state solution."[93] DeLay has long been a strong critic of Cuban leader Fidel Castro's regime, which DeLay has called a "thugocracy", and a supporter of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba.

Previously, in season three of Dancing with the Stars, DeLay publicly campaigned for "his good friend, country music singer, and GOP supporter" Sara Evans, before she withdrew from competition on the show due to her very public and ugly divorce from her then-husband, Republican politico Craig Schelske. On August 19, 2009, while promoting his participation on the upcoming season of Dancing with the Stars, DeLay made political news when he became perhaps the most famous Republican to date to promote the "birther" conspiracy theory about President Obama.[98][99] According to his personal website, since leaving office DeLay has also founded a strategic political consulting firm, First Principles LLC.[95] And, "in addition to his political and business work," the "Meet Tom"[100] section of his site says, "DeLay travels around the country delivering speeches to conservative organizations, Republican events, and college campuses." This "Meet Tom" section adds that "DeLay also spends a great deal of his time... traveling around the country and meeting with major donors, fundraisers, and political operatives, encouraging them to pay more attention to what the Left is accomplishing and how, and asking for their involvement with more outside organizations." DeLay ascribes divine motivation to his political efforts since leaving Congress. "God has spoken to me," the former House Majority Leader told an interviewer. "I listen to God, and what I’ve heard is that I’m supposed to devote myself to rebuilding the conservative base of the Republican Party, and I think we shouldn’t be underestimated."[10] DeLay's website concludes by saying that the former congressman and his wife "continue to be outspoken advocates for foster care reform and are actively involved in a unique foster care community in Richmond, Texas, that provides safe, permanent homes for abused and neglected kids." Rio Bend, a "Christ-centered" community which the DeLays founded, opened in 2005.[101] Blog and book[edit] On December 10, 2006, DeLay launched a personal blog.[102] After joining Dancing with the Stars in August 2008, DeLay scrubbed his personal website of most of its political content and rebranded it as "Dancing with DeLay."[103] In March 2007, DeLay published No Retreat, No Surrender: One American's Fight, co-authored with Stephen Mansfield. The book's foreword is by Rush Limbaugh; the preface, by Sean Hannity. The book contains controversial claims, including DeLay's assertion as fact the claim that the Clinton Administration had sought to have military uniforms banned from the White House, which has been repeatedly proven false.[104][105] Dancing with the Stars[edit] DeLay was a participant on the ninth season of Dancing with the Stars, a reality-TV dance competition show in which celebrities such as DeLay are paired with professional dancers. DeLay's dance partner-instructor was Cheryl Burke, a two-time champion on the highly watched ABC television show. DeLay is the second former politician to compete on the show, following the former mayor of Cincinnati (1977–78), season three's Jerry Springer, better known the last two decades as host of the tabloid television talk show The Jerry Springer Show.[106] In launching his public campaign urging people to vote for Sara Evans during season three in 2006, DeLay cited Springer, a Democrat who at the time also hosted a political radio talk show (Springer on the Radio) in addition to his often raunchy television show, as a reason to vote instead for Evans and against "smut", before Evans had to withdraw from the show due to the very public and sordid break-up of her marriage to Republican politico, Craig Schelske. In August 2009, while giving interviews on the talk-show circuit to promote his participation on season nine of Dancing with the Stars, DeLay made political news on Hardball with Chris Matthews when he became the most famous Republican to date to promote the "birther" conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama. Sara Evans campaign and controversy in Season Three[edit] During season three of Dancing with the Stars in the fall of 2006, DeLay, a big fan of the show according to his wife,[103][107] made his then-biggest foray back into the public spotlight after his resignation from Congress when he launched a public campaign[108] urging people to vote for one of the show's contestants, his "good friend, country music singer and GOP supporter"[109] Sara Evans, in order to promote "good American values in the media" and combat "smut on television", about a month before a very ugly public break-up, complete with dueling and graphic accusations of adultery and pornography,[110][111][112][113] of Evans' marriage to Republican politico Craig Schelske,[114] which caused Evans to withdraw from the competition on October 12, 2006, midway through the show's season.[115] In early September 2006,[109][116] ahead of the season three premiere episode, DeLay wrote, "Sara Evans has been a strong supporter of the Republican Party and represents good American values in the media. From singing at the 2004 Republican Convention to appearing with candidates in the last several election cycles, we have always been able to count on Sara for her support of the things we all believe in.... One of her opponents on the show is controversial talk show host Jerry Springer. We need to send a message to Hollywood and the media that smut has no place on television by supporting good people like Sara Evans. Sara will be a great representative of the values that we want to see in the media, and we should all support her to keep her on the show as long as possible."[109][117] Participation in Season Nine[edit] On September 21, 2009, in his first and main dance[118] for the season nine premiere episode, DeLay donned a sequined, leopard-print lined vest (as part of an outfit he called "Elvis meets animal print")[119] and put on orthopedic shoes (he sustained pre-stress fractures in his feet during training)[120] to perform the cha-cha-cha (complete with air guitar, knee-sliding, finger-pointing, and hip and rear action galore) to The Troggs' 1966 hit song "Wild Thing". (DeLay said "Wild Thing" was an apt description of him during his college days.)[121] DeLay received a score of only 16 out of a possible 30 points from the three-judge panel. The first judge to speak after DeLay finished "Wild Thing," the Bruno Tonioli, stood and exclaimed, "You are crazier than Sarah Palin!"[122][123] (DeLay, who gave Tonioli a big wink and finger-point during the dance, later said, "I think that's a great compliment," of Tonioli's comparison of him to former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate.)[121] Judge Carrie Ann Inaba began her remarks with, "That was surreal."[122] And Head Judge Len Goodman began his verbal review with "Parts were magic; parts were tragic."[122] In DeLay's second dance, by show rules a much shorter and by definition a much more subdued number—the Viennese waltz to Ryan Shaw's Grammy-nominated R&B song "I'm Your Man"—he only garnered four (4) out of a possible 10 points, as he ranked fourth out of the four dancers in his group in the "relay dance." Combined, DeLay's first-week point total placed him in a tie for second-to-last place among the 16 celebrity contestants. For week two of the competition, the assigned dance for the man once known as the "Meanest Man in Congress"[121] was the tango. Remarked DeLay in anticipation of his dance: "Cheryl says the tango’s macho, arrogant and aggressive, and I said, 'That's me.'"[121] Despite a stumble at the end of his routine that almost caused him to drop his partner and fall, DeLay earned a couple points more with his tango to an instrumental version of "Por Una Cabeza", than he did with his week one "Wild Thing" cha-cha-cha. He received straight "6"'s from the three judge panel (Baz Luhrmann of Moulin Rouge! fame subbed for Len Goodman this week), which gave him 18 out of 30 possible points for week two. Unfortunately for the former congressman, that point total landed him in a tie with former supermodel Kathy Ireland for last place among the 14 remaining celebrities. DeLay was spared elimination when the votes from the television audience, combined with the points from the judges, determined Ireland received the lowest overall score for week two. Preparation for week three of the competition was difficult for DeLay, as the pre-stress fractures in his feet turned into full stress fractures. Because of the pain, he was shown in pre-dance footage having to stop practicing at times, including during his pre-show rehearsal the day of his dance. His doctors told him not to dance anymore anytime soon, and they and show producers advised him to withdraw from the remainder of the competition. In announcing his decision to dance anyway, DeLay laughed, "What's a little pain when you can party?"[124] He jokingly added, "I'm insane or stupid—one. I don't know which,"[125] but also cited how his father always used to tell him never to quit. And so, outfitted in red pants with a red and white candy-cane striped shirt (red is the unofficial color of the Republican Party), which had emblazoned on its back a large, sequined version of the GOP's elephant symbol, DeLay and his partner Burke, who wore a blue (the unofficial color of the Democratic Party) dress with white stars and a sequined version of the Dems' donkey symbol, danced the samba (video available [126]) to the bouncy, 1975 song by the band War, "Why Can't We Be Friends?" All three judges (Inaba, Goodman, and Tonioli) praised DeLay tremendously for his effort, but said his injuries unfortunately compromised his performance. They awarded him a combined 15 out of 30 possible points. Once again, however, such a score placed the former congressman low on the leader board, in second-to-last place.[127] On October 6, 2009, DeLay announced he would be leaving competition on the show following the recommendation of his doctors and after consultation with his family. However, he made a special appearance on the season finale to dance the "Texas Two-Step".[128] Discussion of "birther" conspiracy theory[edit] See also: Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories On August 19, 2009, DeLay, making the rounds of various media shows in order to promote his upcoming participation in season nine of Dancing with the Stars, was interviewed by Chris Matthews of Hardball, a political news and talk show on MSNBC. DeLay made political news,[98][99] when, during the interview, he became perhaps the most famous Republican yet to give voice to the so-called "birther" conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama. During his appearance on Hardball, when pressed by Matthews as to whether he supported the conspiracy theory and its adherents and proponents, including several Republican members of Congress, DeLay said, "I would like the president to produce his birth certificate.... I can, most illegal aliens here in America can. Why can't the president of the United States produce a birth certificate?... Chris, the Constitution of the United States specifically says you have to be a 'natural-born citizen' [to be eligible to serve as president]."[98][99] References[edit] ^ [1] Washington Post (Sept. 19, 2013). ^ "Texas Court Of Criminal Appeals Weighing Tom DeLay's Overturned Conviction", Texas Public Radio (June 18, 2014). ^ Texas Court Of Criminal Appeals weighs state's appeal of DeLay exoneration, kut.org; accessed August 21, 2014. ^ [2] ^ [3] ^ Charles Ray DeLay profile, findagrave.com; accessed August 21, 2014. ^ "Tom DeLay Fast Facts".

Snowball sampling
In sociology and statistics research, snowball sampling[1] (or chain sampling, chain-referral sampling, referral sampling[2][3]) is a non-probability sampling technique where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances. Thus the sample group is said to grow like a rolling snowball (similarly to breadth-first search (BFS) in computer science). As the sample builds up, enough data are gathered to be useful for research. This sampling technique is often used in hidden populations which are difficult for researchers to access; example populations would be drug users or sex workers. As sample members are not selected from a sampling frame, snowball samples, analogously to BFS samples,[4][5] are subject to numerous biases. For example, people who have many friends are more likely to be recruited into the sample.

As sample members are not selected from a sampling frame, snowball samples, analogously to BFS samples,[4][5] are subject to numerous biases. For example, people who have many friends are more likely to be recruited into the sample. It was widely believed that it was impossible to make unbiased estimates from snowball samples, but a variation of snowball sampling called respondent-driven sampling[6][7][8] has been shown to allow researchers to make asymptotically unbiased estimates from snowball samples under certain conditions. Snowball sampling and respondent-driven sampling also allows researchers to make estimates about the social network connecting the hidden population.

The term "snowball sampling" reflects an analogy to a snowball increasing in size as it rolls downhill [9] Snowball Sampling is a method used to obtain research and knowledge, from extended associations, through previous acquaintances, "Snowball sampling uses recommendations to find people with the specific range of skills that has been determined as being useful." An individual or a group receives information from different places through a mutual intermediary. This is referred to metaphorically as snowball sampling because as more relationships are built through mutual association, more connections can be made through those new relationships and a plethora of information can be shared and collected, much like a snowball that rolls and increases in size as it collects more snow. Snowball sampling is a useful tool for building networks and increasing the number of participants. However, the success of this technique depends greatly on the initial contacts and connections made. Thus it is important to correlate with those that are popular and honorable to create more opportunities to grow, but also to create a credible and dependable reputation. Method[edit] Draft a participation program (likely to be subject to change, but indicative). Approach stakeholders and ask for contacts. Gain contacts and ask them to participate. Community issues groups may emerge that can be included in the participation program. Continue the snowballing with contacts to gain more stakeholders if necessary. Ensure a diversity of contacts by widening the profile of persons involved in the snowballing exercise. Applications of snowball sampling[edit] Requirement[edit] The participants are likely to know others who share the characteristics that make them eligible for inclusion in the study.[10] Applicable situation[edit] Snowball sampling is quite suitable to use when members of a population are hidden and difficult to locate (e.g. samples of the homeless or users of illegal drugs) and these members are closely connected (e.g. organized crime, sharing similar interests, involvement in the same groups that are relevant to the project at hand).[10] Application field[edit] This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it. 1. Social computing Snowball sampling can be perceived as an evaluation sampling in the social computing field. For example, in the interview phase, snowball sampling can be used to reach hard-to-reach populations. Participants or informants with whom contact has already been made can use their social networks to refer the researcher to other people who could potentially participate in or contribute to the study. 2. Expert information collection Snowball sampling can be used to identify experts in a certain field such as medicine, manufacturing processes, or customer relation methods, and gather professional and valuable knowledge. For instance, 3M called in specialists from all fields that related to how a surgical drape could be applied to the body using snowball sampling. Every involved expert can suggest another expert who they may know could offer more information. Advantages and Disadvantages[edit] Advantages[edit] 1. Locate hidden populations : It is possible for the surveyors to include people in the survey that they would not have known. 2. Locating people of a specific population: There are no lists or other obvious sources for locating members of the population (e.g. the homeless, users of illegal drugs). 3. Low Cost: As subjects are used to locate the hidden population, the researcher invest less money and time in sampling. Snowball sampling method does not require complex planning and the staffing required is considerably smaller in comparison to other sampling methods.[11] Disadvantages[edit] 1. Community Bias: The first participants will have strong impact on the sample. Snowball sampling is inexact, and can produce varied and inaccurate results. The method is heavily reliant on the skill of the individual conducting the actual sampling, and that individual's ability to vertically network and find an appropriate sample. To be successful requires previous contacts within the target areas, and the ability to keep the information flow going throughout the target group.. 2. Not Random: Snowball sampling contravenes many of the assumptions supporting conventional notions of random selection and representativeness[12] However, social systems are beyond researchers' ability to recruit randomly. Snowball sampling is inevitable in social systems. 3. Vague Overall Sampling Size: There is no way to know the total size of the overall population.[10] 4. Wrong Anchoring: Another disadvantage of snowball sampling is the lack of definite knowledge as to whether or not the sample is an accurate reading of the target population. By targeting only a few select people, it is not always indicative of the actual trends within the result group. Identifying the appropriate person to conduct the sampling, as well as locating the correct targets is a time consuming process such that the benefits only slightly outweigh the costs. 5. Lack of control over the Sampling Method : As the subjects locate the hidden population, the research has very little control over the sampling Method, which becomes mainly dependent on the original subject. This is because it's a chain sampling in which the original and subsequent subjects add the sampling pool using a method outside of the researcher's control. Compensations[edit] The best defense against weaknesses is to begin with a set of initial informants that are as diverse as possible.[10] The concentrated efforts of the specialists to improve the main disadvantage of the Snowball Sampling resulted in the Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) based on the referrals of the respondents by means of the combination between the referral method and a mathematical method which weights the sample in order to compensate its selection by a non-random method and where appropriate use of stimulants may lead to reduction of errors occurring in sampling by the referral method.[11] Examples[edit] Snowball sampling is a true multipurpose technique. Through its use, it is possible to make inferences about social networks and relations in areas in which sensitive, illegal, or deviant issues are involved. Equally important is its utility in exploring population about whom little is known. For example, Kaplan et al. have used snowball sampling to study the temporal and social contexts of heroin users.[13] Data[edit] A total of 214 cases was selected by 45 independent snowball sampling operations. Graphically represented, these sampling ranged in "length" (i.e., the number of cases in the sample) from two cases (1-stage snowball sample) to nine cases(8-stage snowball sample). Samples were collected with different "target" traits to saturate. In one subset, "foreign origin" was the trait to be saturated; in the other, it was "prostitution as occupation". In this example, three samples were selected from the data set base for analysis to meet a criterion of holding the "length" of the three samples constant. A length of four cases was decided upon because these samples are complex enough to make statistical analysis practical, but short enough to allow clear and simple qualitative comparisons. Method[edit] A field worker was instructed to start a snowball sample of a particular trait identified as characteristic of the heroin scene. At the zero stage the subject selected was asked to nominate other heroin users sharing that trait (the maximal number of nominees was 25). From the set of those nominated at each stage a simple random selection was made of a single individual. The field worker then attempted to make contact with that nominee. The amount of time in days (speed) required to make contact was recorded, as well as other specified traits of the individuals (e.g., sex, age, drug history, and patterns). Results[edit] Figure 1. The result of one snowball sample Figure 1 graphically shows the traits in this sample in terms or the days it took to find a specific nominee, the operation-alization of speed. Sample one was started with a 27-year-old British heroin user whose referrals included a 19-year-old Italian. After this Italian nominee was selected, it took the field worker 4 days to find him. He then nominated, among others, another Italian, 22 years of age, who was found on the same day. The randomly selected nominee of this third user was a 27-year-old Belgian who could not nominate another. Analysis[edit] After subjects were identified, both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the three samples were conducted, and graphic representations of the data were constructed and marked for relevant traits. Descriptive statistical comparisons were made for the entire data set as well as for the foreign and prostitute subgroups. Inferential statistics were also used to determine whether the distributions for age and the time it took for a field worker to locate a nominee (speed) were significant and whether the respective snowballs were drawn from populations with the same distributions. The second question was seen as especially appropriate for and "ascending" sampling strategy because it cannot be assumed that each snowball is drawn from the same population when only an "imperfect sampling frame" composed of a "special list" compiled by nominees, is available.[14] Because it has been seen as especially appropriate for small samples (as little as three cases) for which population parameters are unknown and cannot be confidently assumed, the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was used. Two-tailed KS tests were performed on the pooled data of the three samples (one-sample test) and on the between-snowballs (subgroups) data (two-samples test). Statistics on Snowball sampling[edit] In U.K. where the telephone coverage is not as high as in USA, Harris(1971) conducted survey of handicapped and impaired. He screened 250,000 households, by mail questionnaires at the initial phase; a response rate of 85.6 percent was obtained. CartWright(1964) sent a mail questionnaires to 29400 persons to identify those who had been in hospitals in the last six months, and obtained a response rate of 87 percent. Hunt(1978) sent a screening questionnaires seeking basic demographic details about the members of 11500 households to identify a sample of elderly, and achieved a response rate of 8O percent. Although these response rates are there is high risk that non-respondents include a larger proportion of members of the rare population.[15] Ethical issues in Snowball sampling[edit] Ethical concerns prevented the research staff from directly contacting many potential respondents, consequently program directors or personnel who knew of possible respondents would make initial contacts and then ask those who were willing to cooperate to personally contact the project. In each instance the newly recruited research assistant had to be trained to understand and accept the eligibility criteria of the research, which often was difficult because it violated some commonsense understandings concerning treatment and nontreatment. For example, many people define themselves as untreated in spite of possible long stays in civil commitment programs because their commitments to these institutions were involuntary and/or because they had become readdicted upon release and then recovered at a later time.[16] In a qualitative research, apprehension around feelings of compulsion are reviewed for potential ethical dilemmas and recommendations for research process are made.[17] Improvements for snowball sampling[edit] Snowball sampling is a recruitment method that employs research into participants' social networks to access specific populations. According to research mentioned in the paper written by Kath Browne,[18] using social networks to research is accessible. In this research, Kath Browne used social networks to research non-heterosexual women. Snowball sampling is often used because the population under investigation is hard to approachable either due to low numbers of potential participants or the sensitivity of the topic. The author indicated the recruitment technique of snowball sampling, which uses interpersonal relations and connections within people.Due to the use of social networks and interpersonal relations, snowball sampling forms how individuals act and interact in focus groups, couple interviews and interviews. As a result, snowball sampling not only results in the recruitment of particular samples, use of this technique produces participants'accounts of their lives. To help mitigate these risks, it is important to not rely on any one single method of sampling to gather data about a target sector. In order to most accurately obtain information, a company must do everything it possibly can to ensure that the sampling is controlled. Also, it is imperative that the correct personnel is used to execute the actual sampling, because one missed opportunity could skew the results. Respondent-driven sampling[edit] A new approach to the study of hidden populations. It is effectively used to avoid bias in snowball sampling. Respondent driven sampling involves both a field sampling technique and custom estimation procedures that correct for the presence of homophily on attributes in the population. The respondent-driven sampling method employs a dual system of structured incentives to overcome some of the deficiencies of such samples. Like other chain-referral methods, RDS assumes that those best able to access members of hidden populations are their own peers. [19] Peer Esteem Snowballing(PEST)[edit] In this article Dr Dimitrios C Christopoulos mentioned that snowball sampling is not a robust measure of reliability when applied to the public, but if we want to investigate small populations of expert opinion, a sampling method like this is perfect for the study. Comparing to other snowballing techniques, PEST has several advantages: a. reduces the selection bias inherent in initial seed samples for a snowball by advocating for a nominations phase that objectively identifies contact seeds for the first wave; b. by analysing network data it provides an estimate of the population size, unbiased by any researcher defined population boundary; c. by reporting the estimate of the sample size vis a vis the population, it provides a measure of relative significance (optimal sampling data can be reported in this context); d. through a network analysis of referrals it allows for identifying clusters of experts that may be instrumental in explain variations in their response profile; e. allows for a referrals nominations strategy that, in certain cases, could improve response rates, while the nominations strategy acts as an ultimate validation of expertise for informants and therefore improves content validity.

Harry Brunette
Harry Walter Brunette (August 19, 1911 – February 19, 1972) was an American bank robber and Depression era outlaw.[1] The Federal Bureau of Investigation He declared him a national "public enemy" when, in 1936, he and his partner Merle Vandenbush (1907–1991)[2] robbed a series of banks in the New York City area, and kidnapped New Jersey state trooper William A. Turnbull. The New York City Police Department managed to find Brunette and Vandenbush hiding out in an apartment on West 102nd Street, on December 14, 1936. Upon locating Brunette, the NYPD informed the FBI of yhe outlaws' whereabouts. Although this was done as a matter of professional courtesy, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover personally led a group of federal agents to take charge of the area.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9] At the time, the FBI was under heavy criticism from the press due to the bureau's overly-aggressive and stronghanded tactics, which had resulted in the shooting deaths of unarmed suspects and innocent bystanders. Hoover hoped to use the situation to set up a "personal arrest" by his second-in-command Clyde Tolson, for propaganda purposes, such as Hoover's own staged arrest of Alvin Karpis in 1934.[4][5][7][8]
Harry Brunette Born (1911-08-19)August 19, 1911 Green Bay, Wisconsin Died February 19, 1972(1972-02-19) (aged 60) Toledo, Ohio Occupation Bank robber Criminal penalty Life imprisonment Conviction(s) Kidnapping (1936) Harry Walter Brunette (August 19, 1911 – February 19, 1972) was an American bank robber and Depression era outlaw.[1] The Federal Bureau of Investigation He declared him a national "public enemy" when, in 1936, he and his partner Merle Vandenbush (1907–1991)[2] robbed a series of banks in the New York City area, and kidnapped New Jersey state trooper William A.

Upon locating Brunette, the NYPD informed the FBI of yhe outlaws' whereabouts. Although this was done as a matter of professional courtesy, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover personally led a group of federal agents to take charge of the area.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9] At the time, the FBI was under heavy criticism from the press due to the bureau's overly-aggressive and stronghanded tactics, which had resulted in the shooting deaths of unarmed suspects and innocent bystanders. Hoover hoped to use the situation to set up a "personal arrest" by his second-in-command Clyde Tolson, for propaganda purposes, such as Hoover's own staged arrest of Alvin Karpis in 1934.[4][5][7][8] Almost from the start, there were problems between the NYPD and the FBI. They had agreed the raid would take place that afternoon at 2:00 pm, when it was believed Brunette would be asleep. However, federal agents moved ahead with the raid and stormed the apartment building at midnight. Confused police detectives, still on stakeout, watched as the raid began 14 hours ahead of schedule. When police officers at the scene questioned Hoover, according to the New York Times, the director "merely shrugged his shoulders."[3][4][5][7][8] Within a few minutes, when a federal agent unsuccessfully attempted to shoot the lock off his door, Brunette was alerted and immediately returned fire. Gas grenades were tossed into his room, inadvertently starting a fire, and the New York City Fire Department was called. The arrival of firefighters added to the confused scene illustrated by a reporter from Newsweek, who described an incident between a firefighter and a federal agent: “ Amid the hubbub, a flustered G-man poked a submachine gun at a husky fireman. "Dammit, can't you read?" growled the fireman, pointing at his helmet. "If you don't take that gun out of my stomach I'll bash your head in."[3][7][8][10] ” Brunette eventually surrendered, and Tolsen was photographed leading him away in his first arrest of his career. However, in their haste to arrest Brunette, federal agents missed Vandenbush, who easily escaped amid the chaos. The following morning, NYPD Commissioner Lewis Valentine and the New Jersey Police Commissioner issued public statements criticizing the FBI's breaking of its agreement with police and putting lives at risk, while allowing Vandenbush to escape. Hoover dismissed these objections, which he referred to as "unjustified and petty criticism". When Vandenbush was captured by New York authorities two months later, the fugitive claimed he had been on his way to meet with Brunette but was warned off by the obvious presence of the FBI. He also said, at one point during the raid he was close enough to "tap J. Edgar Hoover on the shoulder."[3][4][7][8] References[edit] ^ [1] ^ Mass Death record ^ a b c d Cook, Fred J.

He is of Puerto Rican ancestry.[2][2][3][4] Clivillés and Cole also produced various hits for other artists such as Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, Deborah Cooper, Scarlett Santana and many others. In the spring of 2015 Clivillés made his debut as a solo artists with the song "Set Me Free".[5] Contents 1 Musical career 1.1 Production and remix work 2 Controversy 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Musical career[edit] In the late 1980s Robert Clivillés and David Cole were active in 2 Puerto Ricans, a Blackman, and a Dominican and The 28th Street Crew.[6][7] At the time they were the driving force of the short lived Brat Pack.[8] The duo were also responsible for the formation of pop group Seduction, for whom they wrote and produced a string of Top-10 hits. They contributed to the career of former The Weather Girls vocalist Martha Wash who at the same time was one the lead vocalists for the dance act Black Box. And in 1990 Clivillés and Cole released a single, featuring later C+C Music Factory rapper Freedom Williams, called "Get Dumb! (Free Your Body)" as The Crew.[9] But the duo's biggest success was the group C+C Music Factory that scored worldwide in 1991.[10] After the death of his partner David Cole in 1995,[11] Robert Clivillés continued to keep the C+C's legacy alive through his own production work. In 1995, he released a solo single under the name C+C Music Factory, called "I'll Always Be Around" (#1 Billboard Dance/Club Play), on MCA Records. This was the final #1 Dance/Club Play hit for C+C Music Factory. An album titled C+C Music Factory was released by MCA in 1995 in Europe, but it was not released in the US. This was the final studio album of new material to be released under the C+C Music Factory name. The same year, Columbia/SME Records released Ultimate, a greatest hits collection featuring a mixture of remixes and album versions of C+C Music Factory's Sony Music Entertainment singles. Two singles were released in conjunction with the album "I Found Love" (#13 Dance/Club Play) and "Robi Rob's Boriqua Anthem" (#29 Dance/Club Play), which featured Spanish-language reggae artist El General. In October 1996, Robert Clivillés released an album of new material under the name Robi-Rob's Clubworld. The first single from the project, "Shake That Body," featured emcee Ya Kid K, formerly of Technotronic. The second single, "Reach," was a collaboration with Hex Hector and featured vocals from longtime C+C vocalist Deborah Cooper, which was the final recording to have piano tracks recorded by the late David Cole, his C+C partner.[12][13] In the 2000s, Clivillés worked with the group MVP.[14] In 2010 C+C Music Factory reformed with Eric Kupper stepping in to replace Cole.[15][16] In May 2015 Clivillés made its debut at Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart with the song "Free", featured vocals from Kimberly Davis.[5] The music video for "Set Me Free" makes references to Clivillés father's suicide.[5] Production and remix work[edit] Further information: Clivillés and Cole production discography Controversy[edit] In 1989, Clivillés and Cole wrote a song titled "Get Dumb (Free Your Body)" that was covered by The Crew and Seduction. They allegedly illegally sampled portions of "The Music Got Me" which was written by Boyd Jarvis of early-1980s music group Visual. Boyd sued them for copyright infringement in 1990 and originally demanded $15 million in royalties.[17] Four years later, Kevin McCord filed the copyright infringement lawsuit against Mariah Carey, Cole, Clivillés and Columbia Records because, according to McCord, they took parts of his song called "I Want to Thank You" and made "Make It Happen" out of it without permission.[18] Although the allegations were confirmed false, McCord eventually accepted a settlement offer of about US$500,000.[18][19] See also[edit] C+C Music Factory MVP References[edit] ^ Robert Clivillés, Discogs ^ a b c Robert Clivilles Interview from About.com ^ Most Valuable Players from MySpace ^ Robert Clivilles from Facebook ^ a b c Flosstradamus Flies to No. 1 on Top Dance/Electronic Albums, Billboard (1 May 2015) ^ Chep Nuñez, Discogs ^ 28th Street Crew, The, Discogs ^ Brat Pack, The, Discogs ^ Crew, The Featuring Freedom Williams – Get Dumb!

Isembard (vassal of Charlemagne)
Isembard (also spelled Isembart or Isembert) was a vassal (vassus) of Charlemagne. According to the Vita Hludovici, in 805 he took part in Louis the Pious's campaign against the Emirate of Córdoba. He, along with Adhemar, Bera and Burrellus, was one of the leaders of the raiding party that crossed the Ebro river, sacked the Muslim base at Villa Rubea and defeated an army in pitched battle. After twenty days' raiding, they rejoined the main army besieging Tortosa. Isembard may have been leading his own men on this campaign.[1]

For the film sometimes known by this title, see The Last Billionaire. The Last Millionaire is a Reality TV show with a twist - after the weekly challenge, it is the winners rather than the losers that are sent home. The 6 part series was first broadcast in the UK on BBC Three starting 13 November 2008. Contents 1 Format 2 Challenge Themes 3 Winners 4 External links Format[edit] The Last Millionaire takes 12 of Britain's most successful young entrepreneurs and drops them into six of the world's most exciting and demanding cities. Here they face the ultimate business challenge; to make money from scratch in just five days. Used to running successful businesses, these award winning entrepreneurs have proved themselves at home, but can they do it abroad? This time they'll be stripped of their legions of staff, company contacts, personal cash/credit cards and all their business lifelines. All they have left is a small amount of start up capital plus their raw money making talent. To make it even tougher the entrepreneurs won't be travelling in the style they're used to. Instead of five star accommodation they'll be staying in backpacker hostels and surviving on a limited budget for food and drink. The only way back to their lavish lifestyles is to make more money than their rivals. Visiting a new city every week the entrepreneurs must work in pairs. They can choose who they work with each week. And it's only the most successful partnership which gets to go home. The losing pairs continue until there are only two left. In the final week they go head to head where one will become The Last Millionaire. Challenge Themes[edit] Week 1 - Istanbul - Youth, create a product that's aimed at the youth market, due to the high youth population in Istanbul Week 2 - Berlin - The Arts/Performance an event related to the arts or a performance, due to Berlin's popular and plenty art scene Week 3 - Cairo - Tourism, create a product or an event to aim at tourists due to main economy of Cairo being that of tourism Week 4 - Naples - Food and Drink, create a business around the theme, due to food and drink businesses being very popular in Naples Week 5 - Bangkok - Sport and Leisure, create a business related to the theme due to the popular sport and leisure scene which is popular with tourists Week 6 - Hong Kong - East meets West, create a brand new product and sell it within 5 days, with the theme related to the idea of Hong Kong being the location of where East meets West Winners[edit] Week 1 - Istanbul - James Watt, Managing Director of BrewDog Ltd, an award winning microbrewery and Jaqueline Doherty, founder of 2FluidCreative, a web design and solution company Week 2 - Berlin - Oli Norman, founder of DADA, a PR and events company and Oliver Zissman, founder of Totally Fitness and Lady Luisa Week 3 - Cairo - Nathaniel Peat, Founder of The Safety Box Ltd, Martial Arts Guru and Lianne Miller, founder and Managing Director of Young & Pure Week 4 - Naples - Jason Graham, Director of Below Zero and Absolut Ice Bar and Dimple Sthankiya, founder of Dimpleyoga and Director of The Blue Seed Week 5 - Bangkok - Carl Pihl, founder of TicketingHub, Drinkyz and Lost in London and James Taylor, founder of Sport Stars Week 6 - Hong Kong - Lucy Cohen, co-founder of Mazuma UK The Last Millionaire (The Ultimate Loser) - Natalie Haywood, Founder Soundmob and Leaf Tea Shop External links[edit] The Last Millionaire at BBC Online

(April 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Akram Al-Ashqar (Arabic: ???? ????????) (born 1982) is a Palestinian film director, photographer and IT professional. He was born in the city of Tulkarm in the West Bank. He started photography at his childhood, and made short films using his home video camera at that time. Akram graduated from Arab American University in 2006 specializing in Computer Information Technology. His films include: First Picture (2006), Red, Dead, Mediterranean (2006), and Paper War (2007) His short film, “Red, Dead and Mediterranean”, portrays whole generations of Palestinian children who are obsessed with a sea they know nothing about.[1] His short film, “Paper War”, summarizes the Lebanon war through the symbols present on the paper currency used. His first professional documentary film, First Picture (2006), is the story of a Palestinian child from the Tulkarm Camp for Palestinian refugees. This child was born in one of the Israeli prisons. After spending more than two and a half years in prison, he was released independently from his mother, who remains imprisoned by the Israeli Authority. The film follows the child's adventures outside of prison under the protection of his family and with the companionship of his mother's freed friends from prison, and how his experience in prison shapes those adventures. The First Picture (2006) produced by the Arab Institute of Film. Al Ashqar's film Red, Dead and Mediterranean was featured as part of IN FOCUS, a London art exhibition focusing on artist's experiences in the Middle East.

Dallas Black Hawks
The Dallas Black Hawks were a minor-league professional ice hockey team in Dallas, Texas. They were a member of the Central Hockey League and played home games at State Fair Coliseum.

(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Dallas Black Hawks City Dallas, Texas League Central Hockey League Founded 1967 Operated 1967-1981 Home arena State Fair Coliseum Championships Conference Championships 1969, 1972, 1974, 1979 The Dallas Black Hawks were a minor-league professional ice hockey team in Dallas, Texas. They were a member of the Central Hockey League and played home games at State Fair Coliseum. Origins and Relocation to Dallas[edit] The Black Hawks team was originally based in St Louis, Missouri where it was known as the Braves from 1963–67. However, the expansion of the National Hockey League into St Louis resulted in the relocation of the team to Dallas for the 1967–68 season. The Black Hawks remained in Dallas until ceasing operations following the 1981–82 CHL season. During that time, they won 4 Adams Cup championships. The Black Hawks and the Fort Worth Wings/Texans had a legendary rivalry as they competed in the CHL, complete with bench clearing brawls and fights in the stands, including the legendary 10 cent beer night near-riot in Fort Worth in 1978. The Fort Worth Wings/Texans folded at the same time as Dallas, along with the Oklahoma City Stars, which precipitated the demise of the Central Hockey League two years later. Post Folding[edit] After the Black Hawks folded, Dallas would not see another professional hockey club, until the Dallas Freeze was established following the revival of the Central Hockey League for the 1992–93 season. The Freeze, in turn, would be followed by the arrival of the NHL's Minnesota North Stars, which relocated and became the Dallas Stars in 1993.

Los Rojos
Los Rojos is a faction of a Mexican drug trafficking organization known as the Gulf Cartel.[2] The group was formed in the late 1990s during the reign of Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the former leader of the cartel, to provide security to the organization's leaders as the cartel's armed wing.[2]
Los Rojos Founded 1990s by Osiel Cárdenas Guillén Founding location Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico Years active 1990s–present Territory Tamaulipas Ethnicity Mexican Allies Gulf Cartel Rivals Los Metros, Los Zetas[1] Los Rojos is a faction of a Mexican drug trafficking organization known as the Gulf Cartel.[2] The group was formed in the late 1990s during the reign of Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the former leader of the cartel, to provide security to the organization's leaders as the cartel's armed wing.[2] The current leader of Los Rojos is Juan Mejía González, alias El R1.[3][4] On 2 September 2011, Mejía González and Rafael Cárdenas Vela, two leaders of the Rojos, ordered the assassination of the drug lord Samuel Flores Borrego, who commanded the Metros, another faction within the Gulf cartel.[5] The death of Flores Borrego triggered a series of confrontations between the Rojos and the Metros throughout the end of 2011.[6] Nonetheless, in early 2012, the Metros emerged victorious in the infighting and have relegated the Rojos to a less-powerful position in the cartel operatives.[1] Fight with Los Metros[edit] Main article: Infighting in the Gulf Cartel In the late 1990s, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the former leader of the Gulf cartel, had other similar groups besides Los Zetas established in several cities in Tamaulipas.[5] Each of these groups were identified by their radio codes: the Rojos were based in Reynosa; the Metros were headquartered in Matamoros; and the Lobos were established in Laredo.[5] The infighting between the Metros and the Rojos of the Gulf cartel began in 2010, when Juan Mejía González, nicknamed El R-1, was overlooked as the candidate of the regional boss of Reynosa and was sent to the "Frontera Chica," an area that encompasses Miguel Alemán, Camargo and Ciudad Mier – directly across the U.S-Mexico border from Starr County, Texas. The area that Mejía González wanted was given to Flores Borrego, suggesting that the Metros were above the Rojos.[5] Unconfirmed information released by The Monitor indicated that two leaders of the Rojos, Mejía González and Rafael Cárdenas Vela, teamed up to kill Flores Borrego.[5] Cárdenas Vela had held a grudge on Flores Borrego and the Metros because he believed that they had led the Mexican military to track down and kill his uncle Antonio Cárdenas Guillén (Tony Tormenta) on 5 November 2010.[5] Other sources indicate that the infighting could have been caused by the suspicions that the Rojos were "too soft" on the Gulf cartel's bitter enemy, Los Zetas.[2] When the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas split in early 2010, some members of the Rojos stayed with the Gulf cartel, while others decided to leave and join the forces of Los Zetas.[7] InSight Crime explains that the fundamental disagreement between the Rojos and the Metros was over leadership. Those who were more loyal to the Cárdenas family stayed with the Rojos, while those loyal to Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, like Flores Borrego, defended the Metros.[2] Originally, the Gulf cartel was running smoothly, but the infighting between the two factions in the Gulf cartel triggered when Flores Borrego was killed on 2 September 2011.[5] When the Rojos turned on the Metros, the largest faction in the Gulf cartel, firefights broke throughout Tamaulipas and drug loads were stolen among each other, but the Metros managed to retain control of the major cities that stretched from Matamoros to Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas.[8] References[edit] ^ a b "Reynosa rooster honors slain Gulf Cartel boss, Sinaloa alliance".

Contents 1 History 2 Sister ships 3 References 4 External links History[edit] Pride of Free Enterprise was built by Schichau Unterweser AG for European Ferries services between Dover and Calais, initially entering service with them in 1980.[2] In 1987 European Ferries was purchased by P&O European Ferries; in the same year her sister ship, Herald of Free Enterprise capsized just outside Zeebrugge. As a result of these two events, Pride of Free Enterprise was renamed the Pride of Bruges under a rebranding exercise undertaken by P&O following the bad publicity of the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster.[3] In 1998 P&O European Ferries merged its Short sea routes with Stena Line to form P&O Stena Line. As a result of this merger the vessels were again rebranded, this time the vessel was renamed to P&OSL Picardy.[2] In 2000 P&OSL Picardy was laid up pending sale, eventually being sold to Transeuropa Ferries.[2] Transeuropa Ferries renamed the vessel Oleander and introduced a freight only service between Ramsgate and Oostende which began on 4 July 2002.[4] Two years later, on 20 July 2004 the Oleander was joined by the Larkspur to provide a joint passenger/freight service also operating between the two ports.[5] From 2010 onwards the "Oleander" was often sailing on the Spain - Morocco lines on short term leases from TEF to Comarit or FerriMaroc.[2] When TEF went into bankruptcy in April 2013 the Oleander moved on more permanent basis to Acciona Trasmediterránea and sails on the Almeria to Nador route as M/F "Sherbatskiy". The ship was renamed "Sher" for its last voyage to the scrapyard at Alang, India and broken up in late 2015.[2] Sister ships[edit] Spirit of Free Enterprise (1979) - Pride of Kent (1987) - MS Anthi Marina (2006) - scrapped: September 2012.

This is a modified version of a previously existing MPA. The MLPAI is a collaborative public process to create a statewide network of protected areas along California’s coastline. The south coast’s new marine protected areas were designed by local divers, fishermen, conservationists and scientists who comprised the South Coast Regional Stakeholder Group. Their job was to design a network of protected areas that would preserve sensitive sea life and habitats while enhancing recreation, study and education opportunities. The south coast marine protected areas went into effect in 2012. Geography and natural features[edit] This SMCA includes a narrow band of very near shore island marine habitat featuring rocky bottom, kelp forest and rocky, high energy shoreline. This area is bounded by the mean high tide line to a distance of 1000 feet seaward of the mean lower low tide line of any shoreline southeastward of a line connecting the following two points: 1. 33°28.660?N 118°32.310?W? / ?33.477667°N 118.538500°W? / 33.477667; -118.538500?

(4th corner) Habitat and wildlife[edit] The rocky reef, kelp forest and emergent rock habitats in these MPAs support numerous species of invertebrates, plants, fish and marine mammals; among them are garibaldi, rockfish, octopus, gorgonians, nudibranchs, bat rays, kelp bass and many more. The sedentary, invertebrate species located there are set aside from recreational harvest. Recreation and nearby attractions[edit] Catalina Island and its MPAs support world class diving along with numerous hiking, diving and snorkeling, kayaking, fishing and boating activities.[citation needed] Scientific monitoring[edit] As specified by the Marine Life Protection Act, select marine protected areas along California’s south coast are being monitored by scientists to track their effectiveness and learn more about ocean health. Similar studies in marine protected areas located off of the Santa Barbara Channel Islands have already detected gradual improvements in fish size and number.[2] References[edit] ^ California Department of Fish and Game ^ http://www.dfg.ca.gov/marine/channel_islands/pdfs/handout_caselle.pdf External links[edit] Marine Life Protection Act Initiative CalOceans Catalina Visitors Bureau

Guitar player Joe Satriani makes a guest appearance on the track. Relation to Steven[edit] The track is the first confirmed appearance of fictional character/alter ego Steven in more than 15 years. In the song, we learn that he is imprisoned in a lunatic hospital and that his only friends are the insects, rats and his toys on the floor. This tells us that he still has the mind of a small child. Obviously it upset Steven to become an adult. The song possibly suggests something happened that forced him to be like an adult, before he was ready for it. It might be that his parents rejected him; Daddy won't discuss me What a state I must be Mommy couldn't stand living with a wind-up toy Steven feels that he never had the chance to be a young boy and that he grew up too fast. Because of this, he acts like a child and probably thinks that he still is one: Preacher crucifies me Warden wants to fry me I was never young Never just a little boy It is also hinted that Steven still is haunted by the nightmare from Cooper's 1975 album "Welcome to My Nightmare", and possibly also the Curator from the album: I'm lost in a nightmare After the song ends, a little girl's voice can faintly be heard calling "Steven!"

Subject matter expert Turing test
A subject matter expert Turing test is a variation of the Turing test where a computer system attempts to replicate an expert in a given field such as chemistry or marketing. It is also known as a Feigenbaum test[1] and was proposed by Edward Feigenbaum in a 2003 paper.[2]

Strategic reset
Strategic reset was a policy framework designed to stop counterproductive U.S. engagement in a fragmenting Iraq and to strengthen the United States' stance throughout the Middle East. In military terms, "reset" refers to "a series of actions to restore units to a desired level of combat capability commensurate with future mission requirements."[1]
Strategic reset was a policy framework designed to stop counterproductive U.S. engagement in a fragmenting Iraq and to strengthen the United States' stance throughout the Middle East. In military terms, "reset" refers to "a series of actions to restore units to a desired level of combat capability commensurate with future mission requirements."[1] The proposal advocates harnessing U.S. military, economic, and diplomatic power to protect critical national security interests rather than expending this power in efforts to accommodate political progress amid multiple internal and external conflicts in Iraq. The plan for strategic reset entails four key measures: acknowledging Iraq's political and demographic fragmentation implementing prompt phased military redeployment establishing local and regional methods for improving security and diplomacy in the Middle East developing a functional strategy to resolve the Arab–Israeli Conflict. The framework was set forth in a 2007 report by the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C.[2] Contents 1 Background 2 Principles of the strategic reset framework 2.1 Adapting to Iraq's fragmentation 2.1.1 Stopping unconditional arming of security forces 2.1.2 Decentralization 2.2 Phased military redeployment 2.3 Security and diplomacy 2.4 Arab–Israeli conflict 3 Criticisms 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Background[edit] The Center for American Progress developed the framework for strategic reset on the premise that "with the Iraq war well into its fifth year, the Bush administration still lacks a realistic plan for the Middle East and Iraq."[3] Senior Fellows Brian Katulis and Lawrence J. Korb, together with Peter Juul, laid out the plan in the form of a 64-page report released June 25, 2007. In 2007, when retired U.S. Marine Corps Gen. John J. Sheehan published a newspaper editorial explaining his decision not to accept the position of "War Czar" or White House implementation manager for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, he wrote: “What I found in discussions with current and former members of this administration is that there is no agreed-upon strategic view of the Iraq problem or the region. ... [A]fter thoughtful discussions with people both in and outside of this administration, I concluded that the current Washington decision-making process lacks a linkage to a broader view of the region and how the parts fit together strategically.”[4] Citing Gen. Sheehan, the report gives examples from what are described as seven years of relative progress in the Middle East (1994–2000) followed by seven years of setbacks (2001–2007), such as:[5] decline and stall of the Arab–Israeli peace process followed by irruption of war between Israel and Hezbollah Late 1990s containment and sanction of Iraq replaced by refugee crises and war Iran's new global influence and increased progress on its nuclear program Hamas' movement from margin to center of its political stage and victory in the Palestinian legislative election, 2006. Direct relation of oil prices to rising levels of violence in the Middle East Current U.S. strategy in Iraq relies on Iraqi political progress, increased numbers of U.S. troops in the country, and diversification of tactics for political and economic support.[6] While proponents of strategic reset support diversification, particularly as it regards "situat[ing] the strategy in a regional approach,"[6] they strongly oppose sending more U.S. troops to Iraq, and they maintain that the "fundamental premise of Bush’s surge strategy—that Iraq’s leaders will make key decisions to advance their country’s political transition and national reconciliation—is at best misguided and clearly unworkable."[7] In 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group released a report stressing the need for troop withdrawal and for redoubled diplomatic efforts, including efforts to address the Arab–Israeli conflict.[8] The report also said that the Iraqi government "should accelerate assuming responsibility for Iraqi security," and that the "primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq should evolve to one of supporting the Iraqi army, which would take over primary responsibility for combat operations."[9] Supporters of the strategic reset framework disagree with the latter terms, claiming that "the ISG was examining an Iraq that simply does not exist anymore," and that embedding U.S. forces to support Iraqi ones "would create unmanageable force protection problems for U.S. troops."[10] Strategic reset emphasizes making counterterrorism the primary role of U.S. troops, rather than engaging them in sectarian conflict.[11] It also emphasizes the necessity of recognizing Iraq's failed national reconciliation and adapting U.S. policy to the inevitable decentralization of Iraqi politics.[12] In 2007, the Washington Post described as "strategic reset" a proposal by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that took the form of "an unusually detailed public explanation of the new American effort to create a de facto alliance between Israel and moderate Arab states against Iranian extremism."[13] Principles of the strategic reset framework[edit] Advocates of strategic reset maintain that the current administration's misjudgments regarding Iraq policy have jeopardized the United States' national security interests and that it must act now in order to prevent further attrition of its military and to effectively confront a growing global terrorist threat. The strategy requires that U.S. troops rapidly be withdrawn from Iraq and enlisted in efforts to counter this threat, while available political resources are deployed throughout the Middle East in order to minimize conflict in Iraq and to ensure stability in the region at large. It also requires the U.S. to take action on several fronts, especially the Arab–Israeli conflict, in order to build international support and promote regional commitment to this stability. A further requirement is that the international community cooperate to promote rule of law and to encourage legitimate, non-aggressive governments in the Middle East, preventing the formation of "security vacuums" exploited by Al Qaeda.[14] Adapting to Iraq's fragmentation[edit] Since 2005, Iraq's major sectarian conflicts have continued to generate violence at high levels, and Iraq has failed to engineer a political solution to the problems that fuel them.[15] In northern Iraq, Turkmen, Kurds, and Arabs are fighting over the jurisdiction of the Kurdistan Regional Government, and Turkey is conducting raids on the Kurdistan Workers Party.[16] In the south and west, respectively, there is intra-Shi'a violence and violence between Iraqi Sunnis and Sunnis linked to Al-Qaeda; Baghdad and surrounding areas host the deadliest violence in the form of civil war between Sunni and Shi'a.[17] Proponents of strategic reset point out that no significant progress has been made on "benchmarks" established by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice such as constitutional reform or laws regulating provincial elections, distribution of oil revenue, or treatment of citizens subject to de-Baathification; they argue that no realistic policy can predicate the resolution of Iraq's sectarian conflicts on the rule of a unified Iraqi governing authority. On June 26, 2007, for example, Iraqi commandos raided the house of Culture Minister Asad Kamal al-Hashimi, who is believed to have ordered an assassination attempt fatal to both sons of Mithal al-Alusi, a member of Iraq's parliament.[18] According to the CAP, "Iraq's leaders fundamentally disagree on what kind of country Iraq is and should be, and Iraq's political transition has not succeeded in bridging these divides. This lack of political consensus among Iraq's leaders has resulted in a violent struggle for power."[17] Stopping unconditional arming of security forces[edit] Iraqi police on patrol in Karabilah after an IED was found in a girls school Under the strategic reset framework, one immediate response to the political stalemate is cessation of the ongoing provision of weapons to Iraqi security forces, whose number now exceeds 500,000. According to the CAP, these security forces—who continue to receive considerable U.S. support—exhibit divided loyalties that stem directly from divisions in the political structure; they have been implicated in corruption, militia membership, death squads, and killing American troops sent to train them. "The fundamental problem with Iraq's security forces is that they lack the allegiance and in many cases the motivation to defend their country. The United States has poured more than $20 billion into building a national army and police force that does not have the unity and support of its own leaders."[19] Supporters of the strategic reset see two dangers in allowing the current policy of arming and training these security forces to continue: the first danger is that the U.S. is providing weaponry to opposing sides of a civil war. For example, Matthew Yglesias, writing for The Atlantic, has said, "[T]his business of arming and training Iraqi security forces in the absence of a political solution is not just a waste of time and money, but directly counterproductive. Our weapons and funding are fueling civil conflict in the face of deep political fragmentation and there are absolutely no guarantees as to who these arms will be turned against next year or the year after that."[20] The second danger arises from the fact that the majority of Iraq's security forces are Shi'a who constitute "some of the closest allies of America's greatest rival in the Middle East—Iran."[21] Decentralization[edit] A second response to fragmentation in Iraqi politics is decentralization of U.S. policy and power structure in Iraq. The strategic reset framework calls for reassignment of personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad into "provincial outposts" established throughout Iraq. It also calls for the U.S. to forgo building a new Baghdad embassy, one projected to be the world's largest. According to the report, the adoption of this pragmatic, localized approach to placing diplomats and intelligence employees would represent progress on three fronts: It would provide bases for intelligence operations to counter terrorism, allow U.S. officials to give consular support to Iraq's estimated 2 million internally displaced persons, and bring U.S. personnel into closer working relationships with local Iraqi institutions.[22] Phased military redeployment[edit] Phased redeployment is the strategic reset framework's second mainstay. The plan calls for the U.S. immediately to announce "that it does not intend to maintain permanent military bases or forces in Iraq" and to initiate a new deployment structure allowing forces currently serving in Iraq to rotate home, while incoming troops conduct counterterrorism missions from locations such as Turkey, Afghanistan, and Kuwait. A temporary force of 8–10,000 should remain in northern Iraq until 2009, but virtually all other troops are to leave Iraq by September 2008.[23] Redeployment is crucial to the reset strategy chiefly because of its potential to undermine terrorism: proponents argue that U.S military presence in Iraq gives Al-Qaeda a powerful recruiting tool, as well as ideological justification for continued violence. The most damaging blow the U.S. can deal to such organizations in Iraq, they argue, is to withdraw. Ayman al-Zawahri said on May 5, 2007 that a proposed U.S. redeployment would "deprive us of the opportunity to destroy the American forces which we have caught in a historic trap."[24] The reset would remove U.S. troops from Iraq while preserving the ability to strike terrorist targets there and elsewhere. The "post-redeployment U.S. force structure in the Middle East would include: an Army brigade and a tactical air squadron stationed in Kuwait; two light, mobile Army brigades stationed in the northern Kurdish areas [of Iraq]; a Marine Expeditionary unit afloat in the Persian Gulf; and four to five Army combat brigades stationed in Afghanistan to complete the unaccomplished mission of eradicating Al Qaeda there.[25] Security and diplomacy[edit] The plan combines redeployment with initiatives to promote security and diplomacy in the Middle East. These include: Increased efforts to enlist Iraq's neighboring countries in regional progress toward stabilization. The strategy proposes to involve these neighbors by alerting them to the potential local costs of further destabilization; it also suggests that the presence of redeployed U.S. forces will act as a deterrent to those who might otherwise be tempted to exploit Iraq's current weakness.[26] Specific measures to prevent escalation of conflict among Kurds, Turkmens, and Arabs near the northern city of Kirkuk. Kirkuk, rich in oil and populated by a Kurdish majority, is the subject of a scheduled referendum that is expected to result in the city becoming part of Iraqi Kurdistan—a prospect frightening to Kirkuk's minorities as well as to its neighbors Turkey and Syria.[27] Security initiatives aimed at jihadists returning to find targets for violence in their home countries once the United States has left Iraq. The strategic reset capitalizes on connections forged between intelligence networks and local authorities by increased diplomatic efforts.[28] Humanitarian aid to Iraq's refugees. Some 4 million Iraqis have been displaced by the conflict, fleeing either to Egypt, Syria, Jordan and countries in the Persian Gulf region; or to locations mostly within southern and central Iraq.[29] The strategy aims to build international support for these displaced persons. It also suggests that, for moral as well as for political reasons, the U.S. should sharply increase the number of Iraqi refugees it annually accepts, from the current 7,000 up to 100,000.[30] Arab–Israeli conflict[edit] Israeli West Bank barrier Strategic reset requires that U.S. diplomatic efforts to resolve the Arab–Israeli conflict be significantly upgraded. The first major reason for this requirement is that the conflict is considered to have deep destabilizing effects on the entire region; the second is that, since the conflict is seen as a driving force behind anti-American sentiment,[31] enhanced American participation in the peace process would leave the U.S. in a stronger political position regionally. The strategy calls for President Bush to appoint a Middle East envoy and two senior ambassadors as an initial step in this direction.[32] Further key steps would include: Strategies to manage crises such as the Fatah–Hamas conflict Provision of a diplomatic framework to coordinate regional and international peace proposals Diplomatic outreach to Iran and Syria similar to U.S. Cold War diplomatic strategy with China and the Soviet Union "Smartly targeted" rule of law support to alleviate security vacuums caused by political instability[33] Criticisms[edit] David Gooden, writing for the Des Moines Register, has criticized the proposal as "imperial liberalism," claiming that "[F]oreign military occupations are the root cause of Islamic terrorism" and that "[t]he Center for American Progress’ plan for a 'strategic reset' will not achieve a lasting or a just peace."[34] See also[edit] Reset (military) References[edit] ^ "Readiness Committee Written Statement."

Otakar Zich
Otakar Zich (25 March 1879, M?stec Králové – 9 July 1934 Oub?nice u Benešova) was a distinguished Czech composer and aesthetician.
Composer Otakar Zich Otakar Zich (25 March 1879, M?stec Králové – 9 July 1934 Oub?nice u Benešova) was a distinguished Czech composer and aesthetician. Contents 1 Biography 2 Style 3 Selected works 4 References 5 External links Biography[edit] In his music education he studied as a self-taught man. Very years later, he became a pupil of the prominent nineteenth-century Czech aesthetician Otakar Hostinský, and a protégé of the iconoclastic musicologist and critic Zden?k Nejedlý.[1] In the years 1903-1906 he taught physics and mathematics at the High School in Domažlice. In the years leading up to the First World War Zich lived in Prague, actively participating in musical life as a critic. In this capacity he supported the efforts of Nejedlý's pro-Smetana faction against the intellectual descendants of Antonín Dvo?ák, especially during the so-called Dvo?ák Affair 1911-1914, when he called into question the artistic integrity of Dvo?ák's compositional language.[2] These activities firmly allied Zich with Nejedlý's academic circle at Charles University, where, in 1924, he was appointed professor of Aesthetics. He held this position until his death in 1934.[3] Style[edit] As a composer, Zich was largely self-taught, although he can be said to belong to the post-Smetana lineage of Czech composers (which includes Zden?k Fibich, Josef Bohuslav Foerster, and Otakar Ostr?il, all connected in some way to Nejedlý). His main contributions to concert life in Prague were the operas Malí?ský nápad (The Artist's Idea, 1908), Vina (Guilt, 1915), and Preciézky (on Zich's own translation of Molière's Les précieuses ridicules, 1924). He also created several solo vocal and choral compositions. His musical style straddles the divide between late Romanticism and early neo-classicism, combining dense orchestration, Wagnerian leitmotifs, and an intensely linear counterpoint with a playful referentiality to past styles.[4] With the exception of Preciézky and a few individual shorter works, most of Zich's music remains unpublished. Because of his association with Nejedlý, performances of Zich's music often met with bitter controversy in interwar Prague, where critics assessed new compositions based on factional allegiances. The lowest point of this was undoubtedly the premiere of Vina in 1922, which the arch-conservative critic Antonín Šilhan attacked in a vituperative article entitled Finis musicae (The End of Music). Šilhan's argument focused primarily on the opera's orchestral score, where the counterpoint occasionally borders on atonality.[5] Zich was also the author of many folkloric studies and books on aesthetics: foremost among these are Estetické vnímaní hudby (The Aesthetic Perception of Music, 1911) and Estetika dramatického um?ní (The Aesthetics of Drama, 1931). In each of these he explored the application of phenomenology, derived from the work of Hegel and Husserl, to branches of the performing arts, and his theories are still the subject of debate in present-day Czech academic circles. As a musicologist he also devoted himself to the study of Smetana's life and works, with numerous analytical articles appearing in Czech-language music journals.

History of Education Society
The History of Education Society is a professional organization for American historians of education founded in 1960. Its journal is the History of Education Quarterly.

Its journal is the History of Education Quarterly. History[edit] The History of Education Society emerged as the field of the history of education began to coalesce.[1] Early work in the field began in the late 1800s, but became an academic discipline in the early 1900s with the work of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley and Paul Monroe.[1] Teachers in training were then taught the institutional history of American public school education, particularly as "an inevitable outcome of consensus forged by a democratic society".[1] In 1948, the National Society of College Teachers of Education began a History of Education Section.[1] The Section published the History of Education Journal.[1] Scholars argued over the field's aims throughout the 1950s.[1] The Ford Foundation formed a Committee on the Role of Education in American History in 1957 to create a history of education from a history of public schools, an effort to make the field more scholarly.[1] The History of Education Society was founded as an independent organization[1] in 1960, succeeding the Section.[1][2] With its creation came legitimacy for the field as academic study.[1] In 1961, the History of Education Quarterly replaced the History of Education Journal and published the society's work.[1] The journal operated out of the University of Pittsburgh with Ryland W. Crary as its editor and later moved to New York University, Indiana University, Slippery Rock University, and the University of Illinois.[1] Other editors have included William J. Reese.[1] The society was influenced by revisionism in the 1970s, which encouraged its historians to debate American public education's societal and individual roles in the society's journal and annual meetings.[1] Towards the end of the century, the education history field grew to include histories of the family, media, and religion.[1] In 1988,[1] the society affiliated with the International Standing Conference for the History of Education,[2] which hosts annual meetings for the field across North America in conjunction with regional history of education societies.[1] The society also hosts several awards for scholars.[1] Its 2013 annual conference was held in Nashville, Tennessee.[3] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r Altenbaugh, Richard J.

When it began, it was intended primarily as a qualifying tournament for the final knock-out stages of the Malaysia Cup. It was not until 1982 that a League Cup was introduced to recognise the winners of the preliminary stage as the league champions. Over the years, the league competition has gained important stature in its own right. Initially the only teams allowed to participate in the league were the state FA's sides, teams representing the Armed Forces and the Police, and teams representing the neighbouring countries of Singapore and Brunei (though the Football Association of Singapore pulled out of the Malaysian League after the 1994 season following a dispute with the Football Association of Malaysia over gate receipts, and has not been involved since). In recent years, top Malaysian club teams have also been admitted to the league competition. Johor Darul Takzim F.C. is the current Super League Champion. Between 1989 to 1993 and 1998 to 2003, the football league in Malaysia was divided into two levels: First Division: Malaysia Premier 1 League Second Division: Malaysia Premier 2 League Between 1994 to 1997, there was no second level league as the top two leagues were combined. Between 2004 to 2006, the professional football league in Malaysia was divided into 2 levels and 2 groups: First Division: Malaysia Super League Second Division: Malaysia Premier League Group A Second Division: Malaysia Premier League Group B In 2007, the professional football league in Malaysia was only divided into 2 levels when Malaysia Premier League combined into 1 level: First Division: Malaysia Super League Second Division: Malaysia Premier League Starting from 2008 until now, FAM League was introduced to the third tier of Malaysia football league: First Division: Malaysia Super League Second Division: Malaysia Premier League Third Division: FAM League Cups[edit] Malaysia Cup[edit] The Malaysia Cup is a highly-prestigious annual soccer tournament in Malaysia. It is currently the longest-running football competition in Asia. Malaysia Cup history began with the Malaya Cup contested in the 1921 where the championship is accompanied by the states of Malaya. When it involves the final winner of the north and south through the tournament champion is divided respectively. In 1933, Malaya Cup was renamed the HMS Malaya Cup taken in conjunction with the name of the battleship HMS Malaya. Commanding officer of the ship when the captain Ion Beauchamp Butler has donated a trophy and then named it HMS Malaya Cup. World War II forced the cessation of competition from 1942 to 1947 and HMS Malaya Cup restarted in 1948. In 1967 the trophy has been replaced with a new trophy Malaysia Cup. Not long after, a team from the Borneo states of Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei joined Malaysia Cup. Beginning in 1982, a league championship was introduced to determine who qualified for the final. It will be contested after the expiry of Malaysian football league and the only team that showed the best performance in the league are eligible to compete for the Malaysia Cup. But in 1995, Singapore no longer played in the Malaysia League and thus do not played in the Malaysia Cup. This is because the Football Association of Singapore are having problems with the Football Association of Malaysia and finally pulled out in the world of Malaysian football. But before retreating, Singapore managed to win the 1994 Malaysia Cup for the last time. In 1999, the number of teams entering the Malaysia Cup increased by 12 teams. a year later, the number of teams increased to 16 teams and team status for the first time the club managed to join the Malaysia Cup, Johor FC. The first club to win the Malaysia Cup and so far was MPPJ Selangor in 2003. Selangor is the team with the highest achievement in the midst of the Malaysia Cup, winning 32 titles and 16 runner-up. Pahang is the latest winner of the Malaysia Cup. Malaysia FA Cup[edit] The Malaysia FA Cup is a national knock-out soccer competition organised by the Football Association of Malaysia. This trophy was introduced in 1990. Current holder of the FA Cup is Pahang FA.[2] Records[edit] Below are the record of teams in Malaysian football competitions since 1921 till present.

From 1992 to 1998, he was a manager at various agriculture-related businesses. Kalv?tis was one of the founders of People's Party of Latvia in 1997 and was first elected to Saeima, the Latvian parliament, in 1998. He served as the minister of agriculture from 1999 to 2000 and the minister of economics from 2000 to 2002. Kalv?tis was reelected to Saeima and became the leader of the parliamentary faction of People's Party in 2002. On 2 December 2004, he became the Prime Minister of Latvia. Kalv?tis at first led a coalition government consisting of his own People's Party, the New Era Party, the Union of Greens and Farmers and the Latvia's First Party. In April 2006, the New Era Party left the government and Kalv?tis led a minority coalition government consisting of the other three parties. His governing coalition retained power in the 7 October 2006 parliamentary election, winning a slight majority of seats and becoming the first government since Latvian independence in 1991 to be re-elected.[3] It now consists of the People's Party, Union of Greens and Farmers, the Latvia First/Latvian Way Party, and For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK.

Meanwhile, the People’s Party became the largest party in Parliament. Kalv?tis became its chairman. On 7 November 2007, Kalv?tis announced that he would step down on 5 December, after encountering widespread opposition to his dismissal of the head of the anti-corruption bureau, Aleksejs Loskutovs, in the previous month.[4] He accordingly met with President Valdis Zatlers on 5 December and announced his resignation, along with that of his government.[5][6] According to Kalv?tis, speaking on television on the same day, this was necessary to "cool down hot heads".[6] Kalv?tis remained in office in a caretaker capacity until the appointment of his successor Ivars Godmanis.[5] His son, K?rlis Kalv?tis, is a professional ice hockey player.

He saw action during the War with Sextus Pompeius, and the war of Mark Antony and Augustus. He is most notable for his participation during the Battle of Actium, where he was in command of victorious Augustus' central division. He was also instrumental in convincing Octavian to pardon Gaius Sosius, one of Mark Antony's generals, after his capture. Arruntius was consul in 22 BC. He was one of the great military men in the regime whose loyal sword at Augustus' bidding helped deter would-be challengers. His son of the same name Lucius Arruntius the Younger was consul in AD 6. The younger Arruntius played a prominent role in the Senate in the days after Augustus died. Martha Hoffman Lewis included Arruntius among those elevated to patrician status in 29. He attended the Ludi Saeculares in 17 according to an inscription CIL 6.32323 = ILS 5050 as a quindecimvir. According to Gaius Stern, he appears on the Ara Pacis within the college of the quindecimviri sacris faciundis. A Lucius Arruntius is also mentioned in Seneca's Epistulae morales ad Lucilium (Ep. Mor. 114.17) as an imitator of Sallustius' literary style and as the author of a historical work on the Punic War. This could either be the Arruntius mentioned above or his son, the consul of AD 6. An adopted grandson, Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus (cos. AD 32), rebelled against Claudius in a brief civil war, but committed suicide when the rebellion failed in AD 42.

You may get a feel for the people and culture, but the information is really no more than a superficial glimpse."[2] References[edit] ^ http://web.archive.org/web/20030626220740/http://worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/reviews/africa.htm ^ http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/africa-trail/mobyrank External links[edit] Africa Trail at MobyGames Africa Trail at GameFAQs v t e Trail video game series The Oregon Trail The Oregon Trail (1982) The Oregon Trail Deluxe (1992) Oregon Trail II (1995) The Oregon Trail 3rd Edition (1997) The Oregon Trail 4th Edition (2001) The Oregon Trail 5th Edition (2002) The Oregon Trail (2009) The Oregon Trail (2011) The Oregon Trail: American Settler (2011) The Amazon Trail The Amazon Trail (1993) Amazon Trail II (1997) Amazon Trail 3rd Edition (1998) Other titles The Yukon Trail (1994) MayaQuest: The Mystery Trail (1995) Africa Trail (1997) Miscellaneous The Trail to Oregon!

She won many poetry awards, including the Academy of American Poets Prize.[4] Holzman had been performing in sketch comedy for years, "determined to never make a dime,"[1] but on the recommendation of a college friend, she applied to attend the musical theater program at New York University. She eventually got her master's degree in Musical Theatre Writing on a full scholarship. Arthur Laurents was one of her mentors.[1] Other teachers included Stephen Sondheim, Hal Prince, Betty Comden, Adolph Green, and Leonard Bernstein.[2] Theater[edit] Her stage writing credits include Serious Bizness.[4] While at NYU she wrote the musical Birds of Paradise (with composer David Evans), which was produced off-Broadway in 1987 and directed by Laurents.[5] It got scathing reviews.[1] Holzman made her Broadway debut in 2003 when she wrote the book for the Stephen Schwartz musical Wicked, based on the novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire. She won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical. Television writing[edit] In 1988, Dooley got a job in Los Angeles on the TV series Coming of Age. While visiting her brother, cinematographer Ernest Holzman, on the set of thirtysomething, writer Richard Kramer suggested she should write for the show. Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz bought a spec script from Holzman, and she went on to become a staff writer on thirtysomething in 1989.[1] She wrote nine episodes during its last two seasons.[4] Zwick and Herskovitz later executive produced My So-Called Life, a show about a teenage girl. Holzman went from to story editor to executive story editor to a creator and writer of the show.[1] Holzman has collaborated on various short films with her daughter, Savannah. They penned a TV pilot based on the Sasha Paley novel Huge, which ABC Family greenlit in January 2010 with a direct-to-series order.[6][7] Huge premiered in late June 2010. The show team included Holzman, Dooley, her daughter, and her brother, who was the cinematographer.[1] The series was cancelled on October 4, 2010 due to low ratings compared with the network's other summer hits.[8] In 2014, Showtime gave a pilot order to Roadies, a behind-the-scenes comedy about people working with a touring rock band that will be created by Cameron Crowe, J.J. Abrams (executive producing), and Holzman.[9] The TV show will star Luke Wilson, Imogen Poots, Keisha Castle-Hughes, Peter Cambor, Rafe Spall,[10] and Carla Gugino.[11] Acting[edit] Holzman has had a number of acting spots, primarily cameo roles on her own TV shows and a role as a therapist on Curb Your Enthusiasm.

The album was certified gold by the Cámara Argentina de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (CAPIF) and also peaked at number 5 in Argentina. In 2015, A Bailar won Gardel Awards for "Best New Pop Artist Album" and "Best Female Pop Artist Album".[2] Contents 1 Singles 1.1 Promotional singles 2 Promotion 2.1 Tour 3 Awards 4 Track listing 5 Charts performance 5.1 Monthly charts 6 Certifications 7 Release history 8 References Singles[edit] Espósito released "A Bailar" as the lead single on August 12, 2013. The single was a success in Argentina as in other parts of Latin America.[3][4] In 2014, the song won in the category for "Favorite Latin Song" at the Kids' Choice Awards Argentina and for "Best Female Music Video" at the Quiero Awards. "Asesina", was released on October 29, 2013 as a promotional single of the album and it was released on March 10, 2014 as the second single of the album.[5] The song is a hip-hop/pop genre song. It also won an Italian Award for "Song of the Summer" in 2014 and the Quiero Award for "Best Choreography". In November, 2014 Espósito performed "Mil Años Luz" at Susana Giménez, which was released as the third single of A Bailar the same night. The music video is a multi-angle live performance at Opera Allianz in Buenos Aires. The song has won in the category for "Favorite Song" in the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards Argentina. After signing with Sony Music Argentina, Espósito released her fourth single on January 7, 2015 by releasing a lyric video for "Del Otro Lado".[6] The song is a ballad about a couple's misfortunes. A music video was released on March 10, 2015, a year after the "Asesina" music video. "Histeria" was released on September 11, 2015 as A Bailar's fifth and last single along with the music video. The song marks the album's highest charting single as having peaked at No. 3 on the Argentina Los 40 Principales and at No. 2 in Paraguay. Promotional singles[edit] "Amor de Verdad" was released as the first promotional single from A Bailar and it served to promote the deluxe edition of the album. Espósito performed the song a days before its release at the A Bailar Tour, but the song premiered on December 9, 2014 along with A Bailar fanpack edition. The track is included as extra material along with "A Bailar (Triplex Remix)" and the DVD, but it was digital released in single way, separated from the album. The song also provides uncredited vocals by Argentine rapper Zetta Krome. Promotion[edit] In 2014, Espósito perfrormed "A Bailar" and "Asesina" at the ninth season of Bailando por un Sueño. In the same year, the singer performed "Mil Años Luz" at Susana Giménez and "Del Otro Lado at The U-Mix Show. In 2015, she performed "Mil Años Luz" at the tenth edition of Bailando por un Sueño's season premiere and also, at the 2015 Gardel Awards. Espósito first live performance of "Histeria" was at the Kids' Choice Awards Argentina 2015, where also performed "Mil Años Luz". In December, 2015 Espósito performed "Histeria" and "A Bailar" at the tenth edition of Bailando por un Sueño's season finale. Tour[edit] Main article: A Bailar Tour Espósito began a worldwide tour on April 19, 2014 to promote A Bailar due to its international success.

Two-streams hypothesis
The two-streams hypothesis is a widely accepted and influential model of the neural processing of vision as well as hearing.[1] The hypothesis, given its most popular characterisation in a paper by David Milner and Melvyn A. Goodale in 1992, argues that humans possess two distinct visual systems.[2] However, recently there seems to be evidence of two distinct auditory systems as well. As visual information exits the occipital lobe, and as sound leaves the phonological network, it follows two main pathways, or "streams". The ventral stream (also known as the "what pathway") is involved with object and visual identification and recognition. The dorsal stream (or, "where pathway") is involved with processing the object's spatial location relative to the viewer and with speech repetition. Another model for the perceptual/conceptual neuropsychological model of the visual cortex was studied by Raftopoulos.[3] In Russian neuropsychology, yet another model was discussed by Alexander Luria for the anterior/posterior approach to understanding the visual cortex.[4]

The authors themselves credit the inspiration of work on blindsight by Weiskrantz, and previous neuroscientific vision research. Schneider first proposed the existence of two visual systems for localisation and identification in 1969.[5] Ingle described two independent visual systems in frogs in 1973.[6] Ettlinger reviewed the existing neuropsychological evidence of a distinction in 1990.[7] Moreover, Trevarthen had offered an account of two separate mechanisms of vision in monkeys back in 1968.[8] In 1982 Ungerleider and Mishkin distinguished the dorsal and ventral streams, as processing spatial and visual features respectively, from their lesion studies of monkeys – proposing the original where vs what distinction.[9] Though this framework was superseded by that of Milner & Goodale, it remains influential.[10] One hugely influential source of information that has informed the model has been experimental work exploring the extant abilities of visual agnosic patient D.F. The first, and most influential report, came from Goodale and colleagues in 1991[11] and work is still being published on her two decades later.[12] This has been the focus of some criticism of the model due to the perceived over-reliance on findings from a single case. Two visual systems[edit] Goodale and Milner amassed an array of anatomical, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and behavioural evidence for their model, according to which the ventral ‘perceptual’ stream provides the rich and detailed representation of the visual world required for cognitive operations whereas the dorsal ‘action’ stream transforms incoming visual information into the required coordinates for skilled motor behaviour.[2] The model also posits that visual perception encodes the object properties (e.g. size) relative to the properties of other visible objects; in other words it utilises relative metrics and scene-based frames of reference. Whereas the visual control of action uses absolute metrics determined via egocentric frames of reference, computing the actual properties of objects relative to the observer. Thus, grasping movements directed towards objects embedded in size-contrast illusions have been shown to escape the effects of these pictorial illusions, as different frames of references and metrics are involved in the production of the illusion versus production of the grasping act.[13] Norman proposed a similar dual-process model of vision, and described eight main differences between the two systems consistent with other two-system models.[14] Factor Ventral system Dorsal system Function Recognition/identification Visually guided behaviour Sensitivity High spatial frequencies - details High temporal frequencies - motion Memory Long term stored representations Only very short-term storage Speed Relatively slow Relatively fast Consciousness Typically high Typically low Frame of reference Allocentric or object-centered Egocentric or viewer-centered Visual input Mainly foveal or parafoveal Across retina Monocular vision Generally reasonably small effects Often large effects e.g. motion parallax Dorsal stream[edit] The dorsal stream is proposed to be involved in the guidance of actions and recognizing where objects are in space. Also known as the parietal stream, the "where" stream, or the "how" stream, this pathway stretches from the primary visual cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe forward into the parietal lobe. It is interconnected with the parallel ventral stream (the "what" stream) which runs downward from V1 into the temporal lobe. General features[edit] The dorsal stream is involved in spatial awareness and guidance of actions (e.g., reaching). In this it has two distinct functional characteristics—it contains a detailed map of the visual field, and is also good at detecting and analyzing movements. The dorsal stream commences with purely visual functions in the occipital lobe before gradually transferring to spatial awareness at its termination in the parietal lobe. The posterior parietal cortex is essential for "the perception and interpretation of spatial relationships, accurate body image, and the learning of tasks involving coordination of the body in space".[15] It contains individually functioning lobules. The lateral intraparietal sulcus (LIP) contains neurons that produce enhanced activation when attention is moved onto the stimulus or the animal saccades towards a visual stimulus, and the ventral intraparietal sulcus (VIP) where visual and somatosensory information are integrated. Effects of damage or lesions[edit] Damage to the posterior parietal cortex causes a number of spatial disorders including: Simultanagnosia: where the patient can only describe single objects without the ability to perceive it as a component of a set of details or objects in a context (as in a scenario, e.g. the forest for the trees). Optic ataxia: where the patient can't use visuospatial information to guide arm movements. Hemispatial neglect: where the patient is unaware of the contralesional half of space (that is, they are unaware of things in their left field of view and focus only on objects in the right field of view; or appear unaware of things in one field of view when they perceive them in the other). For example, a person with this disorder may draw a clock, and then label it from 12, 1, 2, ..., 6, but then stop and consider their drawing complete. Akinetopsia: inability to perceive motion. Apraxia: inability to produce discretionary or volitional movement in the absence of muscular disorders. Ventral stream[edit] The ventral stream is associated with object recognition and form representation. Also described as the "what" stream, it has strong connections to the medial temporal lobe (which stores long-term memories), the limbic system (which controls emotions), and the dorsal stream (which deals with object locations and motion). The ventral stream gets its main input from the parvocellular (as opposed to magnocellular) layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. These neurons project to V1 sublayers 4C?, 4A, 3B and 2/3a[16] successively. From there, the ventral pathway goes through V2 and V4 to areas of the inferior temporal lobe: PIT (posterior inferotemporal), CIT (central inferotemporal), and AIT (anterior inferotemporal). Each visual area contains a full representation of visual space. That is, it contains neurons whose receptive fields together represent the entire visual field. Visual information enters the ventral stream through the primary visual cortex and travels through the rest of the areas in sequence. Moving along the stream from V1 to AIT, receptive fields increase their size, latency, and the complexity of their tuning. All the areas in the ventral stream are influenced by extraretinal factors in addition to the nature of the stimulus in their receptive field. These factors include attention, working memory, and stimulus salience. Thus the ventral stream does not merely provide a description of the elements in the visual world—it also plays a crucial role in judging the significance of these elements. Damage to the ventral stream can cause inability to recognize faces or interpret facial expression [17] Two auditory systems[edit] Ventral stream[edit] comprehension of the phrase 'my cat' in the extended version of Hickok and Poeppel's dual pathway model Along with the ventral pathway being important for visual processing, it is also important for processing auditory information. During processing, when sound waves enter the ear, this information is transduced into an unanalyzed auditory object. The subcortical auditory pathway then relays the information to the auditory cortex in the dorsal superior temporal gyrus (dSTG). In the dSTG, it is then divided into its constituent phones. These phones are then recognized into phonetic words in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). The information first enters the ventral stream at the posterior middle temporal gyrus and the posterior inferior temporal sulcus p(MTG+ITS). Here the auditory words are converted into semantic words. These words are then converted into a semantic phrase by the first combinatorial net at the anterior portion of the middle temporal lobe and then converted into a syntactic noun phrase at the second combinatorial net. This second combinatorial net is location in the anterior inferior temporal gyrus.[18] Dorsal stream[edit] The function of the dorsal pathway is to map auditory sensory representations onto articulatory motor representations. Hickok & Poeppel claim that the dorsal pathway is necessary because, "learning to speak is essentially a motor learning task. The primary input to this is sensory, speech in particular. So, there must be a neural mechanism that both codes and maintains instances of speech sounds, and can use these sensory traces to guide the tuning of speech gestures so that the sounds are accurately reproduced." [19] repetition of the phrase 'what is your name?' in the extended version of Hickok and Poeppel's dual pathway model Similarly to the ventral stream's auditory processing, information enters the ear and then into the superior temporal gyrus and then finally the superior temporal sulcus. From there the information moves to the beginning of the dorsal pathway, which is located at the boundary of the temporal and parietal lobes near the Sylvian fissure. The first step of the dorsal pathway begins in the sensorimotor interface, located in the left Sylvian parietal temporal (Spt) (within the Sylvian fissure at the parietal-temporal boundary). The spt is important for perceiving and reproducing sounds. This is evident because its ability to acquire new vocabulary, be disrupted by lesions and auditory feedback on speech production, articulatory decline in late-onset deafness and the non-phonological residue of Wernicke's aphasia; deficient self-monitoring. It is also important for the basic neuronal mechanisms for phonological short-term memory. Without the Spt, language acquisition is impaired. The information then moves onto the articulatory network, which is divided into two separate parts. The articulatory network 1, which processes motor syllable programs, is located in the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus and Brodmann's area 44 (pIFG-BA44). The articulatory network 2 is for motor phoneme programs and is located in the left M1-vBA6.[20] Conduction aphasia affects a subject's ability to reproduce speech (typically by repetition), though it has no influence on the subject's ability to comprehend spoken language. This shows that conduction aphasia must reflect an impairment of the ventral pathway but instead of the dorsal pathway. Hickok and Poeppel found that conduction aphasia can be the result of damage, particularly lesions, to the Spt (Sylvian parietal temporal). This is shown by the Spt's involvement in acquiring new vocabulary, for while experiments have shown that most conduction aphasiacs can repeat high-frequency, simple words, their ability to repeat low-frequency, complex words is impaired. The Spt is responsible for connecting the motor and auditory systems by making auditory code accessible to the motor cortex. It appears that the motor cortex recreates high-frequency, simple words (like cup) in order to more quickly and efficiently access them, while low-frequency, complex words (like Sylvian parietal temporal) require more active, online regulation by the Spt. This explains why conduction aphasiacs have particular difficulty with low-frequency words which requires a more hands-on process for speech production. "Functionally, conduction aphasia has been characterized as a deficit in the ability to encode phonological information for production," namely because of a disruption in the motor-auditory interface.[21] Conduction aphasia has been more specifically related to damage of the arcuate fasciculus, which is vital for both speech and language comprehension, as the arcuate fasiculus makes up the connection between Broca and Wernicke's areas.[21] Criticisms[edit] Goodale & Milner's innovation was to shift the perspective from an emphasis on input distinctions, such as object location versus properties, to an emphasis on the functional relevance of vision to behaviour, for perception or for action. Contemporary perspectives however, informed by empirical work over the past two decades, offer a more complex account than a simple separation of function into two-streams.[22] Recent experimental work for instance has challenged these findings, and has suggested that the apparent dissociation between the effects of illusions on perception and action is due to differences in attention, task demands, and other confounds.[23][24] There are other empirical findings, however, that cannot be so easily dismissed which provide strong support for the idea that skilled actions such as grasping are not affected by pictorial illusions.[25][26][27][28] Moreover, recent neuropsychological research has questioned the validity of the dissociation of the two streams that has provided the cornerstone of evidence for the model. The dissociation between visual agnosia and optic ataxia has been challenged by several researchers as not as strong as originally portrayed; Hesse and colleagues demonstrated dorsal stream impairments in patient DF;[29] Himmelbach and colleagues reassessed DF's abilities and applied more rigorous statistical analysis demonstrating that the dissociation wasn't as strong as first thought.[12] A 2010 review of the accumulated evidence for the model concluded that whilst the spirit of the model has been vindicated the independence of the two streams has been overemphasised.[30] Goodale & Milner themselves have proposed the analogy of tele-assistance, one of the most efficient schemes devised for the remote control of robots working in hostile environments. In this account, the dorsal stream is viewed as a semi-autonomous function that operates under guidance of executive functions which themselves are informed by ventral stream processing.[31] Thus the emerging perspective within neuropsychology and neurophysiology is that, whilst a two-systems framework was a necessary advance to stimulate study of the highly complex and differentiated functions of the two neural pathways; the reality is more likely to involve considerable interaction between vision-for-action and vision-for-perception. Rob McIntosh and Thomas Schenk summarize this position as follows: We should view the model not as a formal hypothesis, but as a set of heuristics to guide experiment and theory. The differing informational requirements of visual recognition and action guidance still offer a compelling explanation for the broad relative specializations of dorsal and ventral streams. However, to progress the field, we may need to abandon the idea that these streams work largely independently of one other, and to address the dynamic details of how the many visual brain areas arrange themselves from task to task into novel functional networks.[30]:62[verification needed] References[edit] ^ Eyesenck MW, Keane MT (2010).

United States Senate election in California, 1950

United States Senate election in California, 1950 1946 ? November 7, 1950 ? 1952   Nominee Richard Nixon Helen Gahagan Douglas Party Republican Democratic Popular vote 2,183,454 1,502,507 Percentage 59.23 40.76 Election results by county Senator before election Sheridan Downey Democratic Elected Senator Richard Nixon Republican The 1950 United States Senate election in California followed a campaign characterized by accusations and name-calling. Republican Richard Nixon defeated Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas, after Democratic incumbent Sheridan Downey withdrew during the primary election campaign. Douglas and Nixon each gave up their congressional seats to run against Downey; no other representatives were willing to risk the contest. Both Douglas and Nixon announced their candidacies in late 1949. In March 1950 Downey withdrew from a vicious primary battle with Douglas by announcing his retirement, after which Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy joined the race. Boddy attacked Douglas as a leftist and was the first to compare her to New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who was accused of being a communist. Boddy, Nixon, and Douglas each entered both party primaries, a practice known as cross-filing. In the Republican primary, Nixon was challenged only by cross-filers and fringe candidates. Nixon won the Republican primary and Douglas the Democratic contest, with each also finishing third in the other party's contest (Boddy finished second in both races). The contentious Democratic race left the party divided, and Democrats were slow to rally to Douglas—some even endorsed Nixon. The Korean War broke out only days after the primaries, and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the other had often voted with Marcantonio to the detriment of national security. Nixon's attacks were far more effective, and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20 percentage points, carrying 53 of California's 58 counties and all metropolitan areas. Though Nixon was later criticized for his tactics in the campaign, he defended his actions, and also stated that Douglas's positions were too far to the left for California voters. Other reasons for the result have been suggested, ranging from tepid support for Douglas from President Truman and his administration to the reluctance of voters in 1950 to elect a woman. The campaign gave rise to two memorable political nicknames, both coined by Boddy or making their first appearance in his newspaper: "the Pink Lady" for Douglas and "Tricky Dick" for Nixon.

An attorney, he ran unsuccessfully in 1934 for Lieutenant Governor of California as Upton Sinclair's running mate, and had a reputation as a liberal.[1] As a senator, however, his positions gradually moved to the right, and he began to favor corporate interests.[2] Manchester Boddy, the editor and publisher of the Los Angeles Daily News, was born on a potato farm in Washington state. He had little newspaper experience when, in 1926, he was given the opportunity to purchase the Daily News by a bankruptcy court,[3] but built it into a small but thriving periodical.[4] He shared his views with his readers through his column, "Thinking and Living", and, after initial Republican leanings, was a firm supporter of the New Deal.[5] While the Daily News had not endorsed the Sinclair-Downey ticket,[a] Boddy had called Sinclair "a great man" and allowed the writer-turned-gubernatorial candidate to set forth his views on the newspaper's front page.[6] Both Helen Douglas and Richard Nixon entered electoral politics in the mid-1940s. Douglas, a New Deal Democrat, was a former actress and opera singer, and the wife of actor Melvyn Douglas. She represented the 14th congressional district beginning in 1945.[7] Nixon grew up in a working-class family in Whittier.[8] In 1946, he defeated 12th district Congressman Jerry Voorhis to claim a seat in the United States House of Representatives,[9] where he became known for his anticommunist activities, including his involvement in the Alger Hiss affair.[10] In the 1940s, California experienced a huge influx of migrants, increasing its population by 55%.[11] Party registration in 1950 was 58.4% Democratic and 37.1% Republican.[12] However, other than Downey, most major California officeholders were Republican, including Governor Earl Warren (who was seeking a third term in 1950) and Senator William Knowland.[1] During the 1950 campaign, both Nixon and Douglas were accused of having a voting record comparable to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio. The sole congressman from the American Labor Party at the time, Marcantonio represented East Harlem. He was accused of being a communist,[13] though he denied being one; he rarely discussed the Soviet Union or communism. Marcantonio opposed restrictions on communists and the Communist Party, stating that such restrictions violated the Bill of Rights. He regularly voted against contempt citations requested by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), on which Nixon served.[14] Primary campaign[edit] Democratic contest[edit] Early campaign[edit] Senator Sheridan Downey Douglas disregarded advice from party officials to wait until 1952 to run for the Senate, when Republican Senator Knowland would be up for reelection.[15] Fundraising for the campaign was a concern from the beginning; Douglas friend and aide Ed Lybeck wrote her that she would probably need to raise $150,000 ($1.8 million today),[16] which Douglas considered a massive sum.[17] Lybeck wrote, Now, you can win. You will not be a favorite; you'll be rather a long shot. But given luck and money and a hell of a lot of work, you can win ... but for Christ's sake don't commit suicide with no dough ... Maybe you can't crucify mankind on a cross of gold, but you can sure as hell crucify a statewide candidate upon a cross of no-gold.[17] On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio appearance announcing her candidacy.[15] She attacked Downey almost continuously throughout the remainder of the year,[18] accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests.[19] She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager.[20] Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her.[18] Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas.[21] Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.[22] In January 1950, Douglas opened campaign headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which was seen as a signal that she was serious about contesting Downey's seat and would not withdraw from the race.[12] Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates; Douglas, who was not a good debater, declined.[22] The two candidates traded charges via press and radio, with Downey describing Douglas's views as extremist.[21] Douglas's formal campaign launch on February 28 was overshadowed by rumors that Downey might retire, which Douglas called a political maneuver on Downey's part to get the attention of the press.[22] However, on March 29, amid rumors that he was doing badly in the polls, Downey announced both his retirement and his endorsement of Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy.[23] In his statement, the senator indicated that, due to his ill health, he was not up to "waging a personal and militant campaign against the vicious and unethical propaganda" of Douglas.[24] Boddy filed his election paperwork the next day, on the final day petitions were accepted, with his papers signed by Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron, a Republican, and by Downey campaign manager and 1946 Democratic senatorial candidate Will Rogers, Jr.[25] The publisher had been urged to enter the race by state Democratic leaders and by wealthy oilmen.[26] He had no political experience; Democratic leaders had sought to draft him to run for the Senate in 1946, but he had declined. He later stated that his reasons for running were that the race would be a challenge, and that he would meet interesting people.[27] Boddy, Douglas, and Nixon each "cross-filed", entering both major party primaries.[28] Douglas called Downey's departure in favor of the publisher a cheap gimmick[24] and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator,[29] who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months.[30] The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily News—one of the few big city papers to consistently support her.[31] Boddy versus Douglas[edit] Flyer for the Boddy campaign For the first month of Boddy's abbreviated ten-week campaign, he and Douglas avoided attacking each other.[32] Boddy's campaign depicted him as born in a log cabin, and highlighted his World War I service. The publisher campaigned under the slogan, "Manchester Boddy, the Democrat Every Body Wants."[b] Boddy stated that he was fighting for the "little man", and alleged that the average individual was overlooked by both big government and big labor.[33] However, his campaign, having a late start, was disorganized. The candidate himself had little charisma, and little presence as a public speaker. According to Rob Wagner, who wrote of the campaign in his history of Los Angeles newspapers of the era, Boddy "was all sizzle and no substance".[26] The campaign calm broke off near the end of April 1950, when Boddy's Daily News and affiliated newspapers referred to the congresswoman as "decidedly pink" and "pink shading to deep red".[32] At the end of the month, the Daily News referred to her for the first time as "the pink lady".[32] Douglas generally ignored Boddy's attacks, which continued unabated through May. In a Daily News column, Boddy wrote that Douglas was part of "a small minority of red hots" which proposed to use the election to "establish a beachhead on which to launch a Communist attack on the United States".[34] One Boddy campaign publication was printed with red ink, and stated that Douglas "has too often teamed up with the notorious extreme radical, Vito Marcantonio of New York City, on votes that seem more in the interest of Soviet Russia than of the United States".[34] The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper On May 3, Congressman George Smathers defeated liberal Senator Claude Pepper for the Democratic Senate nomination in Florida.[35] Smathers' tactics included dubbing his opponent "Red Pepper" and distributing red-covered brochures, The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper, that included a photograph of Pepper with Marcantonio.[36] Soon after Smathers' triumph in the primary, which in the days of the yellow dog South was tantamount to election, South Dakota Republican Senator Karl Mundt, who when in the House had served with Nixon on HUAC, sent him a letter telling him about Smathers' brochure. Senator Mundt wrote to Nixon, "It occurs to me that if Helen is your opponent in the fall, something of a similar nature might well be produced ..."[37] Douglas wrote of Senator Pepper's defeat, "The loss of Pepper is a great tragedy, and we are sick about it."[35] She also noted, "What a vicious campaign was carried on against him. No doubt the fur will begin to fly out here too", and "It is revolting to think of the depths to which people will go."[35] Downey reentered the fray on May 22, when he made a statewide radio address on behalf of Boddy, stating his belief that Douglas was not qualified to be a senator.[38] He concluded, "Her record clearly shows very little hard work, no important influence on legislation, and almost nothing in the way of solid achievement. The fact that Mrs. Douglas has continued to bask in the warm glow of publicity and propaganda should not confuse any voter as to what the real facts are."[39] Douglas brought an innovation to the race—a small helicopter, which she used to travel around the state at a time when there were few freeways linking California's cities. She got the idea from her friend, Texas Senator Lyndon Johnson, who had used a helicopter in his close 1948 race. Douglas leased the craft from a helicopter company in Palo Alto owned by Republican supporters, who hoped her influence would lead to a defense contract. When she used it to land in San Rafael, her local organizer, Dick Tuck, called it the "Helencopter", and the name stuck.[40] In early April, polls gave Nixon some chance of winning the Democratic primary, which would mean his election was secured. He sent out mailings to Democratic voters. Boddy attacked Nixon for the mailings; Nixon responded that Democratic voters should have the opportunity to express no confidence in the Truman administration by voting for a Republican. "Democrats for Nixon", a group affiliated with Nixon's campaign, asked Democratic voters "as one Democrat to another" to vote for the congressman, sending out flyers which did not mention his political affiliation.[41] Boddy quickly struck back in his paper, accusing Nixon of misrepresenting himself as a Democrat.[42] A large ad in the same issue by the "Veterans Democratic Committee" warned Democratic voters that Nixon was actually a Republican and referred to him for the first time as "Tricky Dick".[41] The exchange benefited neither Nixon nor Boddy; Douglas won the primary on June 6 and exceeded their combined vote total.[43] Republican contest[edit] Nixon campaign thimble of 1950 In mid-1949, Nixon, although anxious to advance his political career, was reluctant to run for the Senate unless he was confident of winning the Republican primary.[44] He considered his party's prospects in the House to be bleak, absent a strong Republican trend, and wrote "I seriously doubt if we can ever work our way back in power. Actually, in my mind, I do not see any great gain in remaining a member of the House, even from a relatively good District, if it means we would be simply a vocal but ineffective minority."[45][c] In late August 1949, Nixon embarked on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less well known, to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran.[45] With many of his closest advisers urging him to do so, Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat.[18] He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.[46] Nixon announced his candidacy in a radio broadcast on November 3, painting the race as a choice between a free society and state socialism.[47] Chotiner's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition.[48] Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary.[49] The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful.[12][50] Nixon had built part of his reputation in the House on his role in the Alger Hiss affair. Hiss's retrial for perjury after a July 1949 hung jury was a cloud over Nixon's campaign; if Hiss was acquitted, Nixon's candidacy would be in serious danger.[51] On January 21, 1950, the jury found Hiss guilty, and Nixon received hundreds of congratulatory messages, including one from the only living former President, Herbert Hoover.[52] Nixon on his "station wagon tour" in Sausalito At the end of January 1950, a subcommittee of the California Republican Assembly, a conservative grassroots group, endorsed former Lieutenant Governor Frederick Houser (who had lost narrowly to Downey in 1944) over Nixon for the Senate candidacy by a 6–3 vote, only to be reversed by the full committee, which endorsed Nixon by 13–12.[53] Houser eventually decided against running.[54] Los Angeles County Supervisor Raymond Darby commenced a Senate run, but changed his mind and instead ran for lieutenant governor. Darby was defeated by incumbent Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight in the Republican primary.[55] Knight had also been considered likely to run for the Senate, but decided to seek re-election instead.[44] Actor Edward Arnold began a Senate run, but dropped it in late March, citing a lack of time to prepare his campaign.[56] Nixon was opposed for the Republican nomination only by cross-filing Democrats and by two fringe candidates: Ulysses Grant Bixby Meyer, a consulting psychologist for a dating service,[55] and former judge and law professor Albert Levitt, who opposed "the political theories and activities of national and international Communism, Fascism, and Vaticanism" and was unhappy that the press was paying virtually no attention to his campaign.[57] Card from the short-lived Darby for Senator campaign On March 20, Nixon cross-filed in the two major party primaries, and two weeks later began to criss-cross the state in his campaign vehicle: a yellow station wagon with "Nixon for U.S. Senator" in big letters on both sides. According to one contemporary news account, in his "barnstorming tour", Nixon intended to "[talk] up his campaign for the U.S. Senate on street corners and wherever he can collect a crowd."[56] During his nine-week primary tour, he visited all of California's 58 counties, speaking sometimes six or eight times in a day.[23] His wife Pat Nixon stood by as her husband spoke, distributing campaign thimbles that urged the election of Nixon and were marked with the slogan "Safeguard the American Home". She distributed more than 65,000 by the end of the campaign.[35] A Douglas supporter heard Nixon speak during the station wagon tour, and wrote to the congresswoman: He gave a magnificent speech. He is one of the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts ... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.[58] With no serious challenge from Republican opponents, Nixon won an overwhelming victory in the Republican primary, with his cross-filing rivals, Boddy, Douglas, and Desmond, dividing a small percentage of the vote but running well ahead of the two fringe candidates.[49] Joint appearances[edit] Douglas supporter and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (left) with President Truman, September 1950 There were no candidate debates, but Douglas and Nixon met twice on the campaign trail during the primary season. The first meeting took place at the Commonwealth Club[d] in San Francisco, where Nixon waved a check for $100 that his campaign had received from "Eleanor Roosevelt", with an accompanying letter, "I wish it could be ten times more. Best wishes for your success."[49] The audience was shocked at the idea of Eleanor Roosevelt, widow of Democratic former president Franklin Roosevelt and known for her liberal views, contributing to Nixon's campaign.[49] Nixon went on to explain that the envelope was postmarked Oyster Bay, New York, and that the Eleanor Roosevelt who had sent the contribution was Eleanor Butler Roosevelt, the widow of former Republican president Theodore Roosevelt's eldest son.[49][59] The audience laughed,[49] and Douglas later wrote that she had been distracted and gave a poor speech.[e] A memo from Chotiner several days later noted that Boddy had failed to attend the function, and that Douglas wished that she had also not attended.[e] A second joint appearance took place in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval of what she was saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.[49] General election[edit] War in Korea, conflict in California[edit] Helen Douglas for U.S. Senate flyer The rift in the Democratic party caused by the primary was slow to heal; Boddy's supporters were reluctant to join Douglas's campaign, even with President Truman's encouragement.[60] The President refused to campaign in California; he resented Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt. Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Roosevelt, had urged Democrats not to renominate Truman in 1948, but to instead nominate General Dwight Eisenhower.[60] Fundraising continued to be a major problem for Douglas, the bulk of whose financial support came from labor unions.[60] The weekend after the primary, Nixon campaign officials held a conference to discuss strategy for the general election campaign. They decided on a fundraising goal of just over $197,000 (today, about $2,400,000). They were helped in that effort when Democratic Massachusetts Congressman John F. Kennedy, a political opponent of Nixon's, came to Nixon's office and gave him a donation of $1,000 on behalf of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., his father.[61] John Kennedy indicated that he could not endorse Nixon, but that he would not be heartbroken if Douglas was returned to her acting career.[62] Joseph Kennedy later stated that he gave Nixon the money because Douglas was a communist.[61] Nixon's positions generally favored large corporations and farming interests, while Douglas's did not, and Nixon reaped the reward with contributions from them.[63] Nixon favored the Taft-Hartley Act, passage of which had been bitterly opposed by labor unions; Douglas advocated its repeal. Douglas supported a requirement that federally subsidized water from reclamation projects only go to farms of not more than 160 acres (0.65 km2); Nixon fought for the repeal of that requirement.[63] When the Korean War broke out in late June, Douglas and her aides feared being put on the defensive by Nixon on the subject of communism, and sought to preempt his attack.[64] Douglas's opening campaign speech included a charge that Nixon had voted with Marcantonio to deny aid to South Korea and to cut aid to Europe in half.[65] Chotiner later cited this as the crucial moment of the campaign: She was defeated the minute she tried to do it, because she could not sell the people of California that she would be a better fighter against communism than Dick Nixon. She made the fatal mistake of attacking our strength instead of sticking to attacking our weakness.[66][67] Nixon objected to Douglas's speech, stating that he had opposed the Korea bill because it did not include aid to Taiwan, and had supported it once the aid had been included.[68] As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of the Marshall Plan that Douglas's charge had no credibility.[66] In fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.[66] Nixon realized that the battle in California would be fought over the threat of communism, and his campaign staff began to research Douglas's voting record.[61] Republican officials in Washington sent the campaign a report listing 247 times Marcantonio (who generally followed the Democratic line) and Douglas had voted together, and 11 times that they had not.[69] Nixon biographer Conrad Black suggests that Nixon's strategy in keeping the focus on communism was to "distract [Douglas] from her strengths—a sincere and attractive woman fighting bravely for principles most Americans would agree with if they were packaged correctly—to scrapping ... on matters where she could not win."[70] Chotiner stated 20 years later that Marcantonio suggested the comparison of voting records, as he disliked Douglas for failing to support his beliefs fully.[71] Douglas franked envelope used to send a copy of a speech to a California voter Public support for the Korean War initially resulted in anger towards communists, and Nixon advocated the passage of legislation he had previously introduced with Senator Mundt which would tighten restrictions on communists and the Communist Party. Douglas argued that there was already sufficient legislation to effect any necessary prosecutions, and that the Mundt-Nixon bill (soon replaced by the similar McCarran-Wood bill) would erode civil liberties.[72] With the bill sure to pass, Douglas was urged to vote in favor to provide herself with political cover. She declined to do so, though fellow California Representative Chester E. Holifield warned her that she would not be able to get around the state fast enough to explain her vote and Nixon would "beat [her] brains in".[73] Douglas was one of only 20 representatives (including Marcantonio) who voted against the bill. Truman vetoed it; Congress enacted it over his veto by wide margins in late September. Douglas was one of 47 representatives (including Marcantonio) to vote to sustain the veto.[74] In a radio broadcast soon after the veto override, Douglas announced that she stood with the President, Attorney General J. Howard McGrath and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in their fight against communism.[75] Debut of the Pink Sheet[edit] The Pink Sheet On September 10, Eleanor Roosevelt, the late president's widow and the gubernatorial candidate's mother, arrived in California for a quick campaign swing to support her son and Douglas before she had to return to New York as a delegate to the United Nations. Douglas hoped that the former first lady's visit would mark a turning point in the campaign.[76] At a Democratic rally featuring Mrs. Roosevelt the next day in Long Beach, Nixon workers first handed out a flyer headed "Douglas–Marcantonio Voting Record", printed with dark ink on pink paper. The legal-size flyer compared the voting records of Douglas and Marcantonio, principally in the area of national security, and concluded that they were indistinguishable. In contrast, the flyer said, Nixon had voted entirely in opposition to the "Douglas–Marcantonio Axis".[77] It implied that sending Douglas to the Senate would be no different from electing Marcantonio, and asked if that was what Californians wanted.[77] The paper soon became known as the "Pink Sheet".[77] Chotiner later stated that the color choice was made at the print shop when campaign officials approved the final copy, and "for some reason or other it just seemed to appeal to us for the moment".[f] An initial print run of 50,000 was soon followed by a reprint of 500,000, distributed principally in heavily populated Southern California.[f] Douglas made no immediate response to the Pink Sheet, despite the advice of Mrs. Roosevelt, who appreciated its power and urged her to answer it.[78] Douglas later stated that she had failed to understand the appeal of the Pink Sheet to voters, and simply thought it absurd.[78] Nixon followed up on the Pink Sheet with a radio address on September 18, accusing Douglas of being "a member of a small clique which joins the notorious communist party-liner Vito Marcantonio of New York, in voting time after time against measures that are for the security of this country".[79] He assailed Douglas for advocating that Taiwan's seat on the United Nations Security Council be given to the People's Republic of China, as appeasement towards communism.[g] Late in September, Douglas complained of alleged whispering campaigns aimed at her husband's Jewish heritage, and which stated that he was a communist.[80] At the end of September, the splits in the Democratic Party became open when 64 prominent Democrats, led by George Creel, endorsed Nixon and castigated Douglas. Creel said, "She has voted consistently with Vito Marcantonio. Belated flag-waving cannot erase this damning record, nor can the tawdry pretense of 'liberalism' excuse it."[81] According to Creel, Downey was working behind the scenes to secure Nixon's election.[82] James Roosevelt's lackluster campaign led Douglas backers to state that he was not only failing to help Douglas, he was not even helping himself.[83] With polls showing the two major Democratic candidates in dire straits, Roosevelt wrote to President Truman, proposing that Truman campaign in the state in the final days before the election. Truman refused to do so.[84] He also declined Douglas's pleas for a letter of support (privately calling her "one of the worst nuisances"), and even refused to allow her to be photographed with him at a signing ceremony for a water bill which would benefit California.[85] When Truman flew to Wake Island in early October to confer with General Douglas MacArthur regarding the Korean situation, he returned via San Francisco, but told the press he had no political appointments scheduled.[84] He spoke at an event at the War Memorial Opera House during his stopover, but both Roosevelt and Douglas were relegated to orchestra-level seats, far from the presidential box.[84] Vice President Alben Barkley did visit the state to campaign for the Democrats. However, Time magazine wrote that he did not appear to be helpful to Douglas's campaign. The Vice President stated that while he was not familiar with Douglas's votes, he was certain that she had voted the way she did out of sincere conviction and urged Californians to give the Senate a "dose of brains and beauty".[86] Attorney General McGrath also came to California to campaign for the Democrats,[87] and freshman Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota tirelessly worked the San Joaquin Valley, talking to farmers and workers.[88] Name-calling and supporters: the final days[edit] Douglas adopted Boddy's "Tricky Dick" nickname for Nixon, and also referred to him as "pee wee".[89] Her name-calling had an effect on Nixon: when told she had called him "a young man with a dark shirt" in an allusion to Nazism, he inquired, "Did she say that? Why, I'll castrate her."[h] Campaign official Bill Arnold joked that it would be difficult to do, and Nixon replied that he would do it anyway.[h] Nixon returned the attacks; at friendly gatherings and especially at all-male events, he stated that Douglas was "pink right down to her underwear".[88] Flyer for a Douglas rally in San Francisco Douglas's last large-scale advertisement blitz contained another Nazi allusion. Citing five votes in which Nixon and Marcantonio had voted together and in opposition to Douglas, it accused Nixon of using "the big lie" and stated: "HITLER invented it/STALIN perfected it/NIXON uses it".[90] Nixon responded, "Truth is not smear. She made the record. She has not denied a single vote. The iron curtain of silence has closed around the opposition camp."[91] Through the final days of the campaign, he struck a constant drumbeat: Douglas was soft on communism.[92] Though polls showed Nixon well ahead, his campaign did not let up. A fundraising solicitation warned, "Right Now Nixon Is Losing ... Not Enough Money".[93] Skywriting urged voters to cast their ballots for him. Borrowing an idea from Nixon's 1946 campaign, the campaign announced that people should answer their phones, "Vote for Nixon"; random calls would be made from campaign headquarters and households that answered their phones that way would receive scarce consumer appliances. Chotiner even instructed that 18-month-old copies of The Saturday Evening Post, containing a flattering story about Nixon, be left in doctor's offices, barber shops, and other places where people wait across the state.[93] In the last days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper endorsed her, while Truman praised her.[94] Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife,[91] as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor.[95] Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne.[95] Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30 years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.[96][97] Nixon campaign handout Chotiner had worked on Warren's 1942 campaign, but had parted ways from him, and the popular governor did not want to be connected to the Nixon campaign.[98] Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement.[99] Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor,[100] as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet.[96] Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four days to go before the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign, she responded that she hoped and prayed that Roosevelt would be elected.[101] Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner, who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's comments, and the governor responded, "In view of her statement, I might ask her how she expects I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday."[101] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well.[102] Despite the polls, Douglas was confident that the Democratic registration edge would lead her to victory, so much so that she offered a Roosevelt staffer a job in her senatorial office.[103] On election day, November 7, 1950, Nixon defeated Douglas by 59 percent to 41.[104] Of California's 58 counties, Douglas won only five, all in Northern California and with relatively small populations;[i][105] Nixon won every urban area.[106] Although Warren defeated Roosevelt by an even larger margin, Nixon won by the greatest number of votes of any 1950 Senate candidate. Douglas, in her concession speech, declined to congratulate Nixon.[104] Marcantonio was also defeated in his New York district.[107] Aftermath[edit] Candidates[edit] Ticket for Nixon's victory dinner A week after the election, Downey announced that he was resigning for health reasons. Warren appointed Nixon to the short remainder of Downey's term; under the Senate rules at the time, this gave Nixon seniority over the senators sworn in during January.[108] Nixon took office on December 4, 1950.[109] He used little of his seniority, since in November 1952 he was elected vice president as Dwight Eisenhower's running mate, the next step on a path that would lead him to the presidency in 1969. Downey, who as a former senator retained floor privileges, was hired as a lobbyist by oil interests. In 1952, as Republicans took over the White House and control of both houses of Congress, he was fired. An aide stated that the big corporations did not need Downey anymore.[110] Boddy, dispirited by his election defeat and feeling let down by the average citizens for whom he had sought to advocate, lapsed into semi-retirement after his primary defeat. In 1952, he sold his interest in the Daily News, which went into bankruptcy in December 1954.[111] It was rumored that Douglas would be given a political appointment in the Truman administration,[112] but the Nixon-Douglas race had made such an appointment too controversial for the President.[112] According to Democratic National Committee vice-chair India Edwards, a Douglas supporter, the former congresswoman could not have been appointed dogcatcher.[113] In 1952, she returned to acting, and eight years later campaigned for John F. Kennedy during Nixon's first, unsuccessful presidential run.[112] She also campaigned for George McGovern in his unsuccessful bid to prevent Nixon's 1972 reelection, and called for his ouster from office during the Watergate scandal.[114] Less than a week after the election, Douglas wrote to one of her supporters that she did not think there was anything her campaign could have done to change the result.[115] Blaming the war, voter mistrust of Truman's foreign policy, and high prices at home, Douglas stated that she lost in California because Nixon was able to take a large part of the women's vote and the labor vote.[115] Later in November, she indicated that liberals must undertake a massive effort to win in 1952.[116] In 1956, she stated in an interview that, while Nixon had never called her a communist, he had designed his whole campaign to create the impression that she was a communist or "communistic".[113] In 1959, she wrote that she had not particularly wanted to be a senator,[112] and in 1962 she stated that the policy of her campaign was to avoid attacks on Nixon.[112] In her memoirs, published posthumously in 1982, she wrote, "Nixon had his victory, but I had mine ... He hadn't touched me. I didn't carry Richard Nixon with me, thank God."[117] She concluded her chapter on the 1950 race with, "There's not much to say about the 1950 campaign except that a man ran for Senate who wanted to get there, and didn't care how."[118] In 1958, Nixon, by then vice president, allegedly stated that he regretted some of the tactics his campaign had used in the campaign against Douglas, blaming his youth.[119] When the statements were reported, Nixon denied them. He issued press releases defending his campaign, and stating that any impression that Douglas was pro-communist was justified by her record.[119] He said Douglas was part of a whispering campaign accusing him of being "anti-Semitic and Jim Crow".[120] In his 1978 memoirs, he stated that "Helen Douglas lost the election because the voters of California in 1950 were not prepared to elect as their senator anyone with a left-wing voting record or anyone they perceived as being soft on or naive about communism."[121] He indicated that Douglas faced difficulties in the campaign because of her gender, but that her "fatal disadvantage lay in her record and in her views".[121] History and legend[edit] Elections in California Federal government Presidential elections 1852 1856 1860 1864 1868 1872 1876 1880 1884 1888 1892 1896 1900 1904 1908 1912 1916 1920 1924 1928 1932 1936 1940 1944 1948 1952 1956 1960 1964 1968 1972 1976 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 2016 Primary elections Democratic 2000 2004 2008 Republican 2000 2004 2008 2012 United States Senate elections 1950 1980 1982 1986 1988 1992 1992 (special) 1994 1998 2000 2004 2006 2010 2012 2016 Congressional elections At-Large (1849-1863) 1864 1866 1868 1870 1872 1874 1876 1878 1880 1882 1884 1886 1888 1890 1892 1894 1896 1898 1900 1902 1904 1906 1908 1910 1912 1914 1916 1918 1920 1922 1924 1926 1928 1930 1932 1934 1936 1938 1940 1942 1944 1946 12th (1946) 1948 1950 1952 1954 1956 1958 1960 1962 1964 1966 1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 11th (2006) 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 Special elections to the House 5th (2005) 48th (2005) 36th (2007) 12th (2008) 10th (2009) 32nd (2009) 36th (2011) State government (executive) Gubernatorial elections 1849 1851 1853 1855 1857 1859 1861 1863 1867 1871 1875 1879 1882 1886 1890 1894 1898 1902 1906 1910 1914 1918 1922 1926 1930 1934 1938 1942 1946 1950 1954 1958 1962 1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2003 (recall) 2006 2010 2014 2018 Lieutenant gubernatorial elections 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 Attorney General elections 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 Secretary of State elections 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 Treasurer elections 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 Controller elections 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 Insurance Commissioner elections 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 Superintendent of Public Instruction elections 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 State government (legislative) State Senate elections 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 Special State Assembly elections 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 Special State government (judicial) Court of Appeals elections 1994 1998 2002 2006 Propositions 1910-1919 1911 4 7 8 1960-1969 1964 14 1970-1979 1972 11 17 1978 8 13 Briggs Initiative 1980-1989 1982 8 1986 64 65 1988 98 99 1990-1999 1994 187 1996 196 209 215 218 1998 6 10 227 2000-2009 2000 21 22 36 39 2003 53 54 2004 1A 55 56 57 58 59 60 60A 61 62 63 64 65 66 69 71 2005 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 2006 81 82 83 85 87 89 90 2008 91 92 93 94, 95, 96, and 97 98 and 99 1A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 2009 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 2010-2019 2010 13 14 15 16 17 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 2012 29 30 32 34 37 38 39 2014 1 2 41 42 45 46 47 48 2016 50 59 64 Full list Elections by year State elections Nov 1992 Nov 1994 Nov 1996 Nov 1998 Nov 2000 Nov 2002 Nov 2004 Nov 2005 Nov 2006 Feb 2008 Jun 2008 Nov 2008 May 2009 Jun 2010 Nov 2010 Jun 2012 Nov 2012 2014 Jun 2016 Los Angeles Mayoral elections 1896 1898 1900 1902 1904 1906 1909 (M) 1909 (N) 1911 1913 1915 1917 1919 1921 1923 1925 1929 1933 1937 1938 1941 1945 1949 1953 1957 1961 1965 1969 1973 1977 1981 1985 1989 1993 1997 2001 2005 2009 2013 General elections 2009 2011 2013 City Attorney elections 2009 Board of Supervisors elections 2006 2008 2010 2012 San Diego Mayoral elections 2000 2004 2005 (special) 2008 2012 2013–14 (special) 2016 City Council elections 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 San Francisco Mayoral elections 1975 1979 1983 1987 1991 1995 1999 2003 2007 2011 2015 Board of Supervisors elections 1977 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 General elections Mar 2004 Nov 2004 Nov 2005 Jun 2006 Nov 2006 Nov 2007 Feb 2008 Jun 2008 Nov 2008 Nov 2009 Jun 2010 Nov 2010 Nov 2011 Jun 2012 Nov 2012 Nov 2013 San Jose Mayoral elections 2014 v t e Contemporary accounts ascribed the result to a number of causes. Douglas friend and former Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes blamed Roosevelt's weak candidacy and what he believed was Nixon's use of the red scare. Supervisor John Anson Ford of Los Angeles County chalked up the result to Nixon's skill as a speaker and a lack of objective reporting by the press. Douglas's campaign treasurer, Alvin Meyers, stated that while labor financed Douglas's campaign, it failed to vote for her, and blamed the Truman Administration for "dumping" her.[115] Douglas's San Diego campaign manager claimed that 500,000 people in San Diego and Los Angeles had received anonymous phone calls alleging Douglas was a communist, though he could not name anyone who had received such a call.[122] Time magazine wrote that Nixon triumphed "by making the Administration's failures in Asia his major issue".[123] As Nixon continued his political rise and then moved towards his downfall, the 1950 race increasingly took on sinister tones. According to Nixon biographer Earl Mazo, "Nothing in the litany of reprehensible conduct charged against Nixon, the campaigner, has been cited more often than the tactics by which he defeated Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas for senator."[124] Douglas friend[125] and McGovern campaign manager Frank Mankiewicz, in his 1973 biography, Perfectly Clear: Nixon from Whittier to Watergate, focused on the race and the Pink Sheet, and alleged that Nixon never won a free election, that is, one without "major fraud".[122] Historian Ingrid Scobie came to a different conclusion in her biography of Douglas, Center Stage. Scobie concluded that, given voter attitudes at the time, no woman could have won that race. Scobie stated that Nixon's tactics, which used voter anger at communists, contributed to the magnitude of Douglas's defeat, as did the fragmentation of the California Democratic Party in 1950, the weakness of Roosevelt at the head of the ticket, Douglas's idealistic positions (to the left of many California Democrats) and Boddy's attacks.[126] In his early biography of Nixon, Mazo contrasted the two campaigns and concluded, "when compared with the surgeons of the Nixon camp, the Douglas operators performed like apprentice butchers".[127] Both Roger Morris and Greg Mitchell (who wrote a book about the 1950 race) conclude that Nixon spent large sums of money on the campaign, with Morris estimating $1–2 million (perhaps $12 million—$24 million today) and Mitchell suggesting twice that. Gellman, in his later book, conceded that Nixon's officially reported amount of $4,209 was understated, but indicated that campaign finance law at that time was filled with loopholes, and few if any candidates admitted to their full spending. He considered Morris's and Mitchell's earlier estimates, though, to be "guess[es]" and "fantastic".[128] Black suggests that Nixon spent about $1.5 million and Douglas just under half of that.[129] Scobie summed up her discussion of Douglas's defeat, As an actress, she entered Broadway as a star on sheer talent and little training ... [As an opera singer], she sang abroad for two summers, fully expecting that the next step would be the Metropolitan Opera. In politics after five months of working with the [California Democratic] Women's Division, it seemed only natural that she head the state's organization and serve as Democratic National Committeewoman. Restless after three years in those positions, she saw the possibility of becoming a member of Congress as a logical next step. Only four years later, she felt ready to run for the Senate. But her lack of political experience and her inflexible stands on political issues, along with gender questions, eroded the support of the Democratic Party in 1950. What in fact may have hurt her the most is that for which she is most remembered—her idealism.[130] Primary results[edit] Democratic[edit] 1950 United States Senate Democratic primary, California, June 6, 1950[j][131] Candidate Votes Percentage Helen Gahagan Douglas 734,842 46.98% Manchester Boddy 379,077 24.23% Richard Nixon 318,840 20.38% Earl D.

Note that Denton incorrectly says Boddy (pronounced with a long o) served in World War II, not World War I. ^ Republicans controlled the House for only two of the remaining forty-five years of his life. ^ By some accounts, the Press Club. ^ a b Mitchell 1998, p. 37. Some sources claim that Nixon did not explain that it was Eleanor Butler Roosevelt who sent the contribution, apparently in an attempt to get the crowd to think Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt was a supporter. For example, Morris does not mention an explanation of "which Eleanor Roosevelt", despite the contemporaneous account in People Today, most other Nixon biographers do. In Douglas's memoir (Douglas 1982, p. 314) she does not mention an explanation by Nixon and indicates that she left the meeting and called the former first lady, who assured her of her continued support; the former president's later book In the Arena contains (pages 194–195) a recounting of the anecdote, with explanation, with the amount inflated to $500. Fortnight, "From Wild West Barker to US Senator?" May 26, 1950, p. 7 states "One morning, to his astonishment, Nixon received a campaign contribution check for $100 signed Eleanor B. Roosevelt. It was, however, from Oyster Bay, not Hyde Park, Eleanor B. being wife of the grandson [actually son] of the late T.R.". Douglas herself states in her memoir (Douglas 1982, p. 314) that any false attempt by Nixon to claim Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt as a supporter would have been quickly unmasked. ^ a b Morris 1990, p. 581. Chotiner told several variations on this story; this version seems to be the most widespread. ^ Black 2007, p. 161. That transfer would take place in 1971, while Nixon was president. ^ a b Gellman 1999, p. 326. Mitchell places this story in the primary season, and says that Nixon and Douglas were speaking in the same town on the same day; Arnold went to Douglas's rally and reported back to his boss, and the castration exchange followed. ^ Note that most books state that Douglas won only four counties, though Jonathan Bell gets it right. ^ a b 1,911 scattered write-ins combined for both parties not included in totals. Douglas also received 2,326 write-in votes as an Independent-Progressive (Henry A. Wallace's party) but as she was not given that listing on the general election ballot, she must have declined it.

House of Bernadotte
"By the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Wends"
House of Bernadotte Country Sweden, Norway Titles King of Sweden "By the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Wends" King of Norway (1818–1905) "By the Grace of God King of Norway" Founded 1810; 206 years ago (1810) Founder Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte Final ruler Norway: Oscar II Current head Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden Deposition Norway: 1905: dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden The House of Bernadotte, the current royal house of Sweden, has reigned since 1818. Between 1818 and 1905, it was also the royal house of Norway. Its founder, Charles XIV John of Sweden (who was born Jean Bernadotte), was adopted by Charles XIII of Sweden, who belonged to the House of Holstein-Gottorp which was becoming extinct. Contents 1 History of the Royal House 2 French origins 3 Kings of Sweden 4 Kings of Norway 5 Entire royal house 6 See also 7 Sources 8 External links History of the Royal House[edit] Following the Finnish War in 1809, Sweden lost possession of Finland, which had constituted the eastern half of the Swedish realm for centuries. Resentment towards King Gustav IV Adolf precipitated a coup d'état. Gustav Adolf (and his son Gustav) was deposed and his uncle Charles XIII was elected King in his place. However, Charles XIII was 61 years old and prematurely senile. He was also childless; one child had been stillborn and another died after less than a week. It was apparent almost as soon as Charles XIII ascended the throne that the Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp would die with him. In 1810 the Riksdag of the Estates, the Swedish parliament, elected a Danish prince, Prince Christian August of Augustenborg, as heir to the throne. He took the name Charles August, but died later that same year. At this time, Emperor Napoleon I of France controlled much of continental Europe, and some of his client kingdoms were headed by his brothers. The Riksdag decided to choose a king of whom Napoleon would approve. On 21 August 1810, the Riksdag elected Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, a Marshal of France, as heir presumptive to the Swedish throne. Jean Bernadotte, from 1818 to 1844, King Charles XIV. Portrait by Fredric Westin. Bernadotte, born in the town of Pau, in the province of Béarn, France, had risen to the rank of general during the French Revolution. In 1798 he married Désirée Clary, whose sister was married to Joseph, Napoleon's elder brother. In 1804 Napoleon promoted Bernadotte to a Marshal of France. Napoleon also granted him the title "Prince of Pontecorvo". As the Crown Prince of Sweden he assumed the name Charles John (Swedish: Karl Johan) and acted as regent for the remainder of Charles XIII's reign. In 1813, he broke with Napoleon and led Sweden into the anti-Napoleon alliance. When Norway was awarded to Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel, Norway resisted and declared independence, triggering a brief war between Sweden and Norway. The war ended when Bernadotte persuaded Norway to enter into a personal union with Sweden. Instead of being merely a Swedish province, Norway remained an independent kingdom, though sharing a common monarch and foreign policy. Bernadotte reigned as Charles XIV John of Sweden and Charles III John of Norway from 5 February 1818 until his death on 8 March 1844. The House of Bernadotte reigned in both countries until the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. Prince Carl of Denmark was then elected as King Haakon VII of Norway. Carl was a grandson of King Charles XV of Sweden, and a great-great-grandson of Charles XIV. The coat of arms of the House of Bernadotte combines the coat of arms of the House of Vasa (heraldic right) and the coat of arms of Bernadotte as the Prince of Pontecorvo (heraldic left). It is visible as an inescutcheon in the Greater Coat of Arms of the Realm. Some members of the house who lost their royal status and Swedish titles due to unapproved marriages have been given the titles Prince Bernadotte and Count of Wisborg in the nobility of other countries. French origins[edit] King Charles John's first known paternal ancestor was Joandou du Poey, who was a shepherd. He married Germaine de Bernadotte in 1615 in the southern French city of Pau and began using her surname. Through her the couple owned a building there called de Bernadotte.[1] A grandson of theirs, Jean Bernadotte (1649–1698) was a weaver.[2] Another Jean Bernadotte (1683–1760), his son, was a tailor.[3] His son Henri Bernadotte (1711–1780), father of the future Swedish-Norwegian king, was a local prosecutor, from a family of weavers and artisans,[4] who had once been imprisoned for debt.[5][6] This is a modest family which occupies only one floor of the house in a cross street in a popular and peripheral district of Pau.[7] Two branches of the French Bernadotte family survive. The elder descends from Andrew (André) Bernadotte, an older granduncle of Carl John's, with descendants today in the general population of France. The younger branch divided in two, one branch descending from the king's older brother John (Jean Évangéliste) Bernadotte (1754–1813), the heads of which were French barons as of 1810 with Louvie Castle[8] in the south of Pau as their seat (branch extinct with the death of Baron Henry Bernadotte in 1966), and the other branch being the Swedish Royal House.[9] Kings of Sweden[edit] 1818–1844: Charles XIV John (Karl XIV Johan) 1844–1859: Oscar I 1859–1872: Charles XV (Karl XV) 1872–1907: Oscar II 1907–1950: Gustaf V 1950–1973: Gustaf VI Adolf 1973–present: Charles XVI Gustaf Kings of Norway[edit] 1818–1844: Charles III John 1844–1859: Oscar I 1859–1872: Charles IV 1872–1905: Oscar II Entire royal house[edit] The list excludes in-laws and has persons currently alive (2015) in italics, all listed primarily as Swedish royalty unless otherwise noted.

Contents 1 Biographie 2 Theatre 2.1 Career at the Comédie-Française 3 Anecdote 4 References 5 Bibliography 6 External links Biographie[edit] After he studied by the Oratorians, he made his comedian debut at the Théâtre Montmartre in 1826 then toured the French provinces, particularly in Metz and Nantes. He was admitted at the Comédie-Française in 1831, became a sociétaire in 1835 then the dean in 1865 before retiring in 1871. [2] In 1884, he also became a professor at the Paris Conservatory, where among his students were Réjane, Marguerite Durand, Jules-Théophile Boucher and Constant Coquelin.

The name of Charles was substituted at his baptism, but the destruction of civil registers during the Paris Commune allowed him to recover it at the time of the reconstitution of his birth certificate.

Inkan aarre
Inkan aarre (Finnish for "The treasure of the Inca") is a 2005 Finnish board game, designed by Kari Mannerla as a direct sequel to his 1951 board game Afrikan tähti.
Inkan aarre (Finnish for "The treasure of the Inca") is a 2005 Finnish board game, designed by Kari Mannerla as a direct sequel to his 1951 board game Afrikan tähti. Rules[edit] Inkan aarre is mostly similar to Afrikan tähti. Players take turns to move around a board of interconnected cities, picking up tokens in search for the famous treasure of the Inca, a golden sun god statue. The board represents the continent of South America, and the currency used is the Mexican peso. At the start of the game, all tokens are shuffled and placed face down in the cities on the board. All players start from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and receive 300 pesos as starting money. On each player's turn, he/she rolls the die and moves his/her counter. If the player reaches a city with a token, he/she can either pay 100 pesos or stay at the city, waiting until he/she rolls a 4, 5 or 6. The tokens in the game are: Blank: Nothing happens Inca pot: The player gains 300 pesos Silver necklace: The player gains 600 pesos Golden chalice: The player gains 1000 pesos Demon: The player loses all of his/her money Native American guide: On the player's next turn, he/she can travel to any place on the board he/she wants Treasure of the Inca: This is the famous treasure the players are searching for Sun icon: Act as effective substitutes for the treasure of the Inca, once it has been found. Travelling on the ground is free, but travelling by the sea costs 100 pesos for embarkation and 100 pesos for disembarkation. If a player has no money left, he/she can travel on the sea for free, but only 2 places per turn. Players can also use flight routes to fly immediately from one city to another. Flying costs 300 pesos. Once the treasure of the Inca has been found, the first player to take either the treasure, or a sun icon, to Machu Picchu, Peru, wins the game. Differences from Afrikan tähti[edit] The game now has one starting location (Rio de Janeiro) and one ending location (Machu Picchu), these are not interchangeable. The Native American guide is a new token. The additional rule that a player can travel on the sea for free if he/she has no money left has now been made official.

Sprague de Camp, published in paperback by Popular Library in 1976.[1][2] An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.[2][3][4] Contents 1 Contents 1.1 The Virgin of Zesh 1.2 The Wheels of If 2 References Contents[edit] The Virgin of Zesh[edit] Originally published in Thrilling Wonder Stories, February 1953.[5] Earth missionary Althea Merrick, stranded on the planet Krishna and fleeing from an unwanted marriage to a Viagens Interplanetarias official, joins a scientist and poet en route to a utopian Terran colony on the island of Zesh. There she becomes embroiled in the affairs of some peculiarly intelligent aborigines. The story is notable for its satirization of contemporary pseudoscientific movements and for some remarkable parallels to Daniel Keyes's novel Flowers for Algernon, which it predates. The Wheels of If[edit] Originally published in Unknown, October 1940.[6] Lawyer Alister Park is inexplicably torn from his normal existence and thrust into a series of alternate worlds. Each morning he discovers he has become someone else, in a world changed from his own. Ultimately he finds himself a bishop in Vinland, an America that might have been had the early Anglo-Saxons converted to Celtic Christianity and the Franks lost the Battle of Tours. The displacement of his consciousness turns out to have been incidental to a plot directed against his other self, Bishop Scoglund, whose campaign to extend civil rights to Vinland's native inhabitants, the Skraelings, has aroused opposition. To get home Park must continue his counterpart's struggle while somehow unraveling the mystery of how to reunite the minds of all his selves with their proper realities. The story is a classic early alternate history tale. References[edit] ^ Laughlin, Charlotte; Daniel J. H. Levack (1983). De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography.

It is located 16 kilometres (10 miles) northeast of Yerevan and 32 kilometres (20 miles) southeast of the province centre Hrazdan. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town is 43,495, down from 59,000 reported at the 1989 census. With a motorway and railway running through the city connecting Yerevan with the areas of the northeast, Abovyan is considered a satellite city of the Armenian capital. Therefore, Abovyan is generally known as the "northern gate of Yerevan". The town of Abovyan covers an area of 11 square kilometres (4.2 square miles).

The excavations led by Smbatiants revealed that the area of modern-day Abovyan was inhabited starting from the end of the 4th century BC. During the ancient Kingdom of Armenia, the western area of modern-day Abovyan was part of the "Kotayk" canton of Ayrarat province while the eastern area was part of "Mazaz" canton of the same province. Between the 5th and 7th centuries AD, the region was granted to the Amatuni Armenian noble dynasty. After the Seljuk invasion of Armenia, the area became to be known as Elar. According to the Armenian historian Stepanos Orbelian of the 13th century, Elar became part of the Zakarid Principality of Armenia under the protectorate of the Georgian Kingdom. The region of Elar was granted to prince Liparit Orbelian of the Orbelian Dynasty by prince Ivane I Zakarian. By the beginning of the 16th century, Eastern Armenia fell under the Persian rule, and Elar became part of the Erivan Beglarbegi and later of the Erivan Khanate. After the Russian conquest of Armenia in 1828, Elar became part of the Armenian Oblast and subsequently of the Erivan Governorate formed in 1850. The small village of Elar (currently part of Abovyan) remained the largest settlement in the area until 1961, when it was renamed Abovyan in honour of the Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian. 2 years later in 1963, the town of Abovyan was founded by the decision of the Soviet government, occupying the village of Elar and the surrounding areas. The modern town was built in 1962–1963 on a plateau located between Hrazdan and Azat rivers. It has rapidly developed as an industrial centre within the Armenian SSR. The town was planned to include 8 residential neighbourhoods (locally known as micro-districts), and an industrial district. Geography and climate[edit] Mount Ara overlooking the town from the northwest Abovyan is built on Kotayk plateau between the rivers of Hrazdan, Azat and Getar at a height of 1450 meters above sea level. It is surrounded by Gutanasar volcano of Gegham mountains from the north, Mount Hatis from the east, the heights of Nork from the south, Hrazdan gorge from the west and Mount Ara from the northwest. and The climate is continental and dry with relatively hot summers and cold winters.

It remained closed since the Soviet days until 2010 when it was entirely renovated and reopened for the public on 28 November of the same year. The other church of the town is the Saint John the Baptist Church opened in 2013 by the efforts of the Armenian businessman Gagik Tsarukyan. The architect of the church is Artak Ghulyan. It is one of the largest places of worship in Armenia. There is a small Molokan Russian community in the town. Culture[edit] A khachkar in Abovyan Abovyan has a cultural palace and a public library. The town is also home to a museum opened in 1982 and dedicated to the brotherhood and friendship between the Armenian and Russian nations. The Abovyan day is celebrated every year in mid October.[4] Transportation[edit] Being approximately located in northeastern Yerevan, Abovyan is connected with capital city with buses and minibuses that are in service 24 hours a day. The H-1 Road connects Abovyan with Yerevan, while the M-4 Motorway connects the town with the rest of Armenia. Economy[edit] Central Abovyan Abovyan was founded by the Soviets as an industrial town. It used to have many large industrial firms until the fall of the Soviet Union, including a concrete factory, a stone-processing plant and a chemicals factory. Currently, the town is home to the largest brewery in Armenia, known as Kotayk Brewery, founded in 1974. The factory is owned by Gagik Tsarukyan's Multi Group Holding and produces a variety of lager beer under the brands Kotayk, Erebuni and Abovyan's Tshani.[5] Other industrial firm operating in the town include the Abovyan cannery and soft drinks plant, and the "Tamara" factory for dairy products. Education[edit] As of 2015[update], Abovyan has 10 public education schools, 9 kindergartens and 2 state intermediate colleges. It is also home to the Abovyan University named after Levon Orbeli. 2 major science institutions and research centres are located in Abovyan: the Republican Hospital of tuberculosis, and the Institute of Biological Microbes of the Armenian National Academy of Sciences. Many cultural centres operate in the city, such as the cultural palace of Abovyan, the community creative centre for children and teenagers, the musical school, the art school, the public library and the museum of Abovyan. Sport[edit] Abovyan City Stadium with Mount Hatis in the background FC Kotayk founded in 1955, is one of the oldest football clubs in Armenia who represented Abovyan until 2005. Like many other football clubs in the country, FC Kotayk was forced to default from the Armenian football league and consequently from professional football in 2005, due to financial difficulties. The short-lived King Delux FC represented the town in a single season of the Armenian First League in 2012–13 before going defunct. The town has the Abovyan City Stadium with a capacity of 3,946 seats. The sports academy of the town is operated by the town council.

Capital services
In economics, capital services refer to a chain-type index of service flows derived from the stock of physical assets and software. These assets are coordination, equipment, software, structures, land, and inventories. Capital services are estimated as a capital-income weighted average of the growth rates of each asset. Capital services differ from capital stocks because short-lived assets such as equipment and software provide more services per unit of stock than long-lived assets such as land.[1] Unlike capital goods, capital services are owned by the person or group of people providing them.[2]

Her father was a Potchefstroom City Councillor before joining the Democratic Alliance and becoming a member of the North West Provincial Legislature.[1] Career[edit] In 2001, Terblanche was a Potchefstroom City Councillor alongside her father.[2] She was then a member of the National Council of Provinces where she was best known for passing a 2004 motion censuring Thabo Mbeki for his attitude to rape.[1] In 2008 Terblanche was promoted to Whip in the NCOP,[1] before becoming the representative for the constituency of Ventersdorp/Tlokwe (Potchefstroom). In 2009, she was the DA Home Affairs Spokesperson.[3] In 2011, she was the Democratic Alliance's candidate for mayor of Potchefstroom.[4] In June 2014, Terblanche was named as Deputy Spokesperson in the Science and Technology portfolio.[5] In 2014, charges were laid against Deputy Minister for Higher Education Mduduzi Manana for, among other things, "manhandling" Terblanche, in a brawl in parliament.[6][7][8] In October 2015, Terblanche was expelled from the Democratic Alliance for misuing funds, along with Dianne Kohler Barnard, who was fired for a racist Facebook post.[9][10][11] The ANC called it a "public relations stunt."[12] Terblanche said the misconduct inquiry was "erroneous, misleading and defamatory" and said she would appeal to the High Court.[13] She was later reinstated.

Vatslav Vorovsky Vatslav Vatslavovich Vorovsky (Russian: ??????? ??????????? ??????????; Polish: Wac?aw Worowski) (1871 - 1923) was a Marxist revolutionary, literary critic, and Soviet Russian diplomat. One of the first Soviet diplomats, Vorovsky is best remembered as the victim of a May 1923 political assassination in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he was the official representative of the Soviet government to the Conference of Lausanne. Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Early years 1.2 Political career 1.3 Diplomatic career 1.4 Death and legacy 2 Footnotes 3 Works 4 Further reading Biography[edit] Early years[edit] Vatslav Vorovsky was born October 27, 1871 (n.s.) in Moscow, the son of an ethnic Polish engineer.[1] Following the completion of secondary school, Vorovsky enrolled at the University of Moscow, where he was exposed to the ideas of political radicalism.[1] Political career[edit] Vorovsky became active in the socialist movement in 1895.[1] He was arrested by the Tsarist secret police shortly thereafter and sentenced to three years' exile in the city of Orlov.[1] Upon his release, Vorovsky adopted a new underground pseudonym, "P. Orlovsky," as a tribute to this experience.[1] During the course of his underground career, Vorovsky also used the pseudonyms "Y. Adamovich," "M. Schwarz," "Josephine," and "Felix Alexandrovich."[1] Vorovsky emigrated to Europe in 1902, spending time in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland.[1] In 1903 he affiliated himself with the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, becoming an editor of the official organ of the party, Vperyod (Forward), in 1905.[1] During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Vorovsky returned to Russia, working actively as a revolutionary in St. Petersburg.[1] Following the defeat of the 1905 uprising he moved to Odessa in the Ukraine, where he was a leading underground Bolshevik from 1907 to 1912.[1] In 1912, Vorovsky was arrested again, this time to be deported to Europe.[1] Vorovsky returned to Russia in 1915, landing in Petrograd — the new name of St. Petersburg — but he was soon sent to Stockholm by a business firm.[1] He was the first director of Gosizdat, the State Publishing House, from its foundation in 1919 until 1921.[2] Diplomatic career[edit] Following the victory of the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917, Vorovsky was named the Soviet government's diplomatic representative to Scandinavia, remaining based in Stockholm.[1] In Stockholm, Vorovsky was the point of contact between the new Bolshevik government and representatives of the government of Germany, being introduced by Alexander Parvus to such luminaries of the German Social-Democratic Party as Philipp Scheidemann during November and December 1917.[3] In December 1918, Sweden, responding to pressure on the part of the Allied powers who were intent upon imposing an unbreakable blockade, withdrew official recognition of Vorovsky as the representative of Soviet Russia.[4] This action on the part of the Swedish government forced Vorovsky's return to Russia the following month.[5] This action taken against Vorovsky followed the precedent followed by Great Britain in expelling Maxim Litvinov in September 1918 and that of Germany in expelling Adolph Joffe in November of that same year.[6] In March 1919, Vorovsky served as a member of the Soviet delegation to the Founding Congress of the Communist International.[1] He was named the representative of the Russian Communist Party to the Executive Committee of the Comintern.[1] He also served as one of the secretaries of the organization, along with Angelica Balabanova.[7] Grigorii Zinoviev was tapped as president of the organization.[7] In July 1920, Vorovsky resumed work as a Soviet diplomat, participating in diplomatic negotiations with Poland.[1] From 1921 to 1923, Vorovsky was the Soviet representative to Italy.[1] In that capacity he was involved in attempts at negotiation of a trade agreement between the two countries, with a preliminary pact signed in December 1921.[8] This success proved short-lived, however, as negotiations to extend the six-month treaty failed in May 1922.[8] Vorovsky was a member of the Soviet delegation to the 1922 Genoa Conference, a group headed by Soviet Foreign Minister Georgii Chicherin. Death and legacy[edit] Vorovsky's final diplomatic mission came in the spring of 1923, when he served as Soviet representative to the Lausanne conference of 1923.[1] Accompanied by two diplomatic attachés, Vorovsky arrived in Lausanne from Rome on April 27, hoping to force the conference's official participants to recognize Soviet interests in the Turkish Black Sea Straits.[9] On May 9, Vorovsky dispatched his final report to Moscow, noting that three days earlier a group of right wing youths had appeared at his hotel and sought a meeting. Vorovsky wrote: "I refused to receive them, and Comrade Ahrens, who went out to them to find out what it was all about, disposed of them at once, telling them that they should put such matters before their Government. Now they are going about the town declaring that they will compel us to leave Switzerland by force, and so on. "As to whether the police are taking any measures for our safety, we have no idea. At any rate, it is not apparent on the surface. It is only too evident that behind these hooligan boys there is some conscious directing hand — possibly foreign. The Swiss Government, well aware of what is going on — for the papers are full of it — must bear responsibility for our safety. The behaviour of the Swiss Government is a shameful violation of the guarantees given at the beginning of the conference, and any attack on us in this particularly well-organised country is only possible with the knowledge and permission of the authorities. On them is the responsibility."[10] On the evening of May 10, 1923, Vorovsky was seated at a dining table in the restaurant of his hotel with his colleagues when the group was approached by an individual they did not know. The unknown figure, a Russian White émigré named Maurice Conradi, pulled a gun and shot Vorovsky to death, wounding his two companions, Ahrens and Dilvilkovsky, in the attack.[9] Conradi was defended by the advocate Théodore Aubert and later acquitted by the Swiss court in the epilogue of what would be known as the Conradi affair. It was later alleged that the murder was actually ordered by Stalin [11] Vatslav Vorovsky was 51 years old at the time of his death.

The Other Side (Tonight Alive album)
The Other Side is the second studio album by Australian rock band Tonight Alive.
The Other Side Studio album by Tonight Alive Released September 6, 2013 Recorded Summer 2012, Coffs Harbour, Australia Genre Pop punk,[1][2][3] pop rock,[4] alternative rock,[3] emo pop[5] Length 39:52 Label Sony Music Australia, Fearless, Search and Destroy Producer Dave Petrovic Tonight Alive chronology What Are You So Scared Of? (2011) The Other Side (2013) Limitless (2016) Singles from The Other Side "The Ocean" Released: June 24, 2013 "Lonely Girl" Released: July 31, 2013 "Come Home" Released: September 20, 2013 The Other Side is the second studio album by Australian rock band Tonight Alive. Contents 1 Composition 2 Release 3 Critical reception 4 Track listing 5 Personnel 6 References 7 External links Composition[edit] Vocalist Jenna McDougall spoke to Alternative Press about the record: "There are definitely some sad songs on the album, and I think there are a few heartbreakers, but there are also songs like 'The Fire' that's a super-liberating, empowering punk song. I'm so proud of that song because the lyrics are really passionate, affirmative and positive, but the music is really aggressive. [...] "We are quite, not a bipolar band, but I think this album is really about finding our sound but at the same time also accepting that we don't have one particular sound. Not all our songs are going to be the same, and you can't put them under the same umbrella. Some of them are poppy, some of them are really heavy and some of them are somewhere in the middle. We found a balance on this record, and I'm proud of that because I think it's just being true as human beings. You can be at both ends of the scale."[6] McDougall explain that there is "a lot more cohesive [because] I know my voice a lot better. I'm excited because the songs have got a very pop structure but [they've] still got a lot of edge."[7] The title track was originally three verses longer but the band edited the track down.[8] This original version was more country-orientated and was inspired by "Your Guardian Angel" by The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus.[9] It was edited down as the band expected the song to be released as a single and work "better as a radio song", according to McDougall.[9] McDougall found the decision "hard for me" as the song was personal to her.[9] The chorus was completely rewritten a moment before McDougall was going to record her vocals for the song.[9] It "tells the story of going from being friends to falling in love, and then the complications that followed before becoming just friends again."[9] Release[edit] After playing a few dates in Australia in May for the first time in a year, Tonight Alive came back in support of the new album, also performing two Rolling Stone Live Lodge acoustic shows in Sydney. They also played Warped Tour Australia 2013. On July 31, 2013, the band revealed the track listing on their Facebook page. "The Ocean" was released as the album's first single to digital outlets and YouTube preceding the album. "Lonely Girl" was later made as an instant download for those pre-ordering the album through iTunes. The Other Side was released on September 6, 2013 on Sony Records Australia, in Europe and the UK on September 9, and September 10 in the US through Fearless Records as well as Japan on September 11.[10] Critical reception[edit] Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating Allmusic [5] Alternative Press [11] Alter the Press! [12] Kerrang! Punknews.org [13] Rock Sound Music Mayhem Magazine The Other Side debuted at No. 5 on the Australian ARIA albums chart, No. 43 on the US Billboard 200 and No. 59 in the UK.[14] It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the album's direction and musicianship. The Other Side received very positive reviews upon its release. Rob Foster of Kill Your Stereo reviewed the album positively: "The Other Side isn't just a step in the right direction. No, it's miles further than that. This is certainly the most accomplished thing Tonight Alive have released in their career yet, and frankly, given the quality of their previous releases, that says a lot. Tonight Alive are an excellent representation of Australian music in the international market, and 'The Other Side' backs that up magnificently."[15] Track listing[edit] All songs written and composed by Jenna McDougall and Whakaio Taahi, except where noted.  No. Title Length 1.

Following the sale, she moved from Lancashire, England, to Italy, where she restored a 15th-century Italian monastery that for a time she and her husband operated as a venue for weddings and holidays.[1][2][5] Career[edit] In 2009, Abbott decided to write a book about an average, everyday woman put into a situation where she had no other option but to commit murder.[4] It took Abbott 18 months to write the first draft.[5][6] In November 2011, after it was rejected by several literary agents, Abbott, then 59, self-published her first novel, Only the Innocent, on Amazon, under her pen name.[2][5] The book sold slowly at first, with sales taking off after Abbott put together a strong marketing campaign.[7][8] Abbott followed up Only the Innocent in 2013 with The Back Road and in 2014 with Sleep Tight.[6] Her fourth novel, Stranger Child, was published on February 24, 2015.[9] Later that year, she published the novella Nowhere Child, which has the same characters as Stranger Child.[10] In 2016, she published her sixth novel, Kill Me Again.[11] Her five novels and one novella all focus on relationships and crime, and all feature the same detective, Chief Inspector Tom Douglas.[6] Abbott has described the character as "a genuinely honest, nice guy who just seems to be attracted to the wrong women."[12] Working with an agent since 2012,[2] she self-publishes in the UK, and through a publisher in North America.[13] Her books have been translated into seven different languages.[9] By 2015, Abbott's first three novels, all self-published in the UK, with the first two published by Thomas & Mercer in the US, had combined to sell one million copies.

(August 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Jason Shevchuk is an American singer and guitarist for the band None More Black.[1] None More Black announced an indefinite hiatus in 2007 but later regrouped. On May 20, 2008, None More Black announced that they were back with a singular show scheduled for July 4, 2008, in Philadelphia. He is the former singer for Kid Dynamite and singer and guitarist for LaGrecia. Before Kid Dynamite, he was the vocalist for screamo band "Bound." Shevchuk became the vocalist of Kid Dynamite after winning an audition with his melodic yet abrasive voice and catchy "whoa-whoa-whoas". He left Kid Dynamite in 2000 to pursue film editing work. His first film, Ghetto Venue, was about the recently closed Philadelphia club Stalag 13. He still edits film and has worked on music videos with None More Black and other bands, such as The Loved Ones. However, his musical urges led to the birth of his next band, None More Black. Shevchuck started to write and record his own solo material under the name OnGuard. As of early June 2007, the OnGuard MySpace page all but vanished, with all songs and pictures/information removed. However, later he put up a website which has the project's "entire discography".[2] Shevchuk emerged on MySpace with the band LaGrecia saying OnGuard is "officially dead" and changed its name while becoming a full band including Dana Berkowitz on Drums and Sal Dell'Aquila on Bass. The band released their first and only album, "On Parallels," on June 24, 2008, on Suburban Home Records. The cover artwork for the album was done by Dell'Aquila. The band broke up just before the release of "On Parallels." Consequently, LaGrecia's remaining duo of Sal and Dana announced via the band's MySpace account that Shevchuk had left the band and the LaGrecia project was finished.

Whatever the reaction of American audiences will be, Before It Had a Name is certainly amongst the most pleasing – and decidedly auteur – surprises of the Venice Days.[1] ” References[edit] ^ a b "Before It Had a Name : In the name of love".

Elaine Makatura Bass
Elaine Bass (née Makatura) is an American film title designer and filmmaker.
Elaine Bass Born Elaine Makatura 1927 (age 88–89) New York Nationality American Occupation Graphic designer, title designer, film director Spouse(s) Saul Bass (1961–1996; his death; 2 children) Elaine Bass (née Makatura) is an American film title designer and filmmaker. Elaine worked for 40 years alongside Saul Bass, a graphic designer, title designer, and filmmaker whom she married in 1961. Together, they developed many projects for directors such as Martin Scorsese and Danny DeVito. She is one of the main designers who helped to elevate the short film and the title sequence to an art form. Contents 1 Early life 2 Design career 3 Film title design 4 Film title sequences 5 Filmmaker 6 Legacy 7 See also 8 References 9 Further reading 10 External links Early life[edit] Elaine Bass was born in 1927 in New York City, United States, to Hungarian immigrants.[1] The youngest of four daughters, Elaine showed early promise at art, creating stories and drawing them, frame by frame, on the sidewalk. In the early 1940s, the girls began singing professionally as the Belmont Sisters. At the age of twelve, Elaine was admitted to the New York High School of Music and Art but withdrew in order to pursue her professional singing. She was the lead singer and soloist, and recordings made when she was fourteen to eighteen reveal a surprisingly mature voice singing swing with touches of Billie Holiday.[2] During WWII, the group sang in service clubs and on the radio until the oldest sisters left the group to get married. Design career[edit] At age eighteen and after six years of singing with her sisters, Elaine went to work in the New York fashion industry, producing fashion renderings and sketches for several fashion houses. In 1947, she moved to Los Angeles, settling there permanently in 1954. Soon thereafter she found a job in the design department of Capitol Records. She recalled: "After about a year I was looking for something more challenging when someone told me that Saul Bass was looking for an assistant. I had enjoyed the credits for The Seven Year Itch very much but the name 'Saul Bass' didn't mean anything to me."[3] Elaine joined the office in 1955 and by 1959, Saul was delegating important tasks to her. In 1960, she co-directed and co-produced the opening title sequence to Spartacus. The following year, Saul and Elaine married and after the birth of their children, Jennifer in 1964 and Jeffrey in 1967, Elaine concentrated on motherhood, film directing, and title sequences. Film title design[edit] Elaine designed title sequences alongside Saul Bass for more than 40 years, and employed diverse filmmaking techniques from Bunraku-style maneuvers in Spartacus (1960), live action sequences in Walk on the Wild Side (1962), to time-lapse photography in The Age of Innocence (1993), and even chopped liver in Mr. Saturday Night (1992). From the mid-60s to the late 1980s, Saul and Elaine moved away from main titles to focus on filmmaking and their children: “Elaine and I feel we are there to serve the film and to approach the task with a sense of responsibility. We saw a lot of pyrotechnics and fun and games and I suppose we lost interest. At the same time, an increasing number of directors now sought to open their own films in ambitious ways rather than hire someone else to do it. Whatever the reasons, the result was ‘Fade Out.’ We did not worry about it: we had too many other interesting projects to get on with. Equally, because we still loved the process of making titles, we were happy to take it up again when asked. ‘Fade In’…"[4] Toward the end of his career, the Basses were rediscovered by James L. Brooks and Martin Scorsese who had grown up admiring Bass's film work.[5] For Scorsese, Saul and Elaine Bass[6] created title sequences for Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), The Age of Innocence (1993), and Casino (1995), their last title sequence. This later work with Martin Scorsese saw the Basses move away from the optical techniques that Saul Bass had pioneered in his early career and move into the use of computerized effects. These later title sequences featured new and innovative methods of production and startling graphic design. Screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi said of Saul and Elaine Bass, "You write a book of 300 to 400 pages and then you boil it down to a script of maybe 100 to 150 pages. Eventually you have the pleasure of seeing that the Basses have knocked you right out of the ballpark. They have boiled it down to four minutes flat."[7] In some sense, all modern opening title sequences that introduce the mood or theme of a film can be seen as a legacy of Saul and Elaine Bass's innovative work. Film title sequences[edit] Spartacus (1960) West Side Story (1961) Walk on the Wild Side (1962) Nine Hours to Rama (1963) The Victors (1963) Seconds (1966) Grand Prix (1966) Broadcast News (1987) Big (1988) The War of the Roses (1989) Goodfellas (1990) Cape Fear (1991) Doc Hollywood (1991) Mr. Saturday Night (1992) The Age of Innocence (1993) Higher Learning (1995) Casino (1995)[8] Filmmaker[edit] During the 1960s, the Basses were asked by directors and producers to produce not only title sequences for their films, but they were also commissioned to create short films for various corporations and events. Saul and Elaine's first joint venture into short filmmaking was with promotional films for pavilions at the 1964 New York World's Fair, co-produced with Sy Wexler, entitled "From Here to There" for United Airlines and "The Searching Eye" for Eastman Kodak. In 1968, they made the short film "Why Man Creates", which won the Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject. An abbreviated version of that film was broadcast that year on the first episode of the television newsmagazine 60 Minutes. In 2002, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[9] Saul and Elaine Bass directed several other short films, two of which were nominated for Academy Award Oscars; Notes on the Popular Arts in 1977, and The Solar Film in 1979, the latter for which Robert Redford was the executive producer. In 1984, they directed the film "Quest", co-written by Ray Bradbury, for the Mokichi Okada Association. Legacy[edit] Although Saul and Elaine Bass collaborated closely for more than 40 years and Saul himself often spoke of Elaine and used the pronoun "we" when interviewed alone, she is not widely acknowledged as co-creator of these important cinematic works. Indeed, even contemporary critics of the 60s generally focused on Saul alone, referring to him as "Bass" and "a master." In fact, Elaine often directed individual sequences and participated as equal partner in the tasks of producing, writing, cinematography, and editing, and always played a leading role in choosing the music and working with the composer, but is still often ignored or seen as an addendum by filmmakers and journalists. For instance, Quentin Tarantino, when speaking about Scorsese's collaboration with the Basses, has said: "Saul Bass was undoubtedly the greatest title sequence maker. Brilliant – just brilliant. He has been a 'hero' for years. But, and it's a big but, I could never do what Scorsese does – give up control of the opening of my film to someone else, not even Saul Bass – I guess I should say Saul and Elaine Bass."[10] See also[edit] Design portal Biography portal Film portal Motion graphics Title sequences Richard Amsel Drew Struzan Howard Terpning References[edit] ^ Jennifer Bass and Pat Kirkham, Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design, Laurence King Publishing, 2011, pg.22 ^ Jennifer Bass and Pat Kirkham, Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design, Laurence King Publishing, 2011, pg.22 ^ Jennifer Bass and Pat Kirkham, Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design, Laurence King Publishing, 2011, pg.22 ^ Jennifer Bass and Pat Kirkham, Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design, Laurence King Publishing, 2011, pg.264 ^ "Library | Exhibitions and Events | Saul Bass: biography".

Middle Ages[edit] Slavs settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. The province was known as Dendra in Greek, and Glubo?ica (?????????, later Dubo?ica) in Slavic. Dendra was given to Serbian ruler Desa in 1155.[6][7][8] It was then held by Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja.[6] The Battle of Dubo?ica took place on September 24, 1454, between the Serbian Despotate and the invading Ottoman Empire, and ended in a Serbian victory. During Ottoman rule Leskovac was part of the Sanjak of Niš.[9] The Jasunje monasteries dedicated to the Virgin of Transfiguration and St. John the Baptist were built in 1499 as an endowment of sister Ksenija. Early modern[edit] The Church of St. John the Baptist was built in the 16th century. Modern[edit] Odžaklija, the secret church Leskovac became part of Serbia after the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, at which time Serbia also became fully independent from the Ottoman Empire. Full independence from the Ottoman Balkans initially had a negative impact on trade. However, by the end of the 19th century, the town of Leskovac was famous across the Balkans for its workshops which turned hemp into rope. Leskovac was known as Leskofça during Ottoman rule and was bounded to Ni? sanjak until 1878. Soon there were three watermill-driven lace producers in the region. In 1896, the founders of these companies pooled their resources and bought factory equipment for the production of woollen cloth from the German Empire. This was the first factory on the outskirts of the town. In 1903, a factory for hemp processing was built on the riverbank north of the old town centre. Amidst the First Serbian Uprising of the Serbian revolution (1804–1815), a forbidden Serbian Orthodox church was built in the town, through tricking the Turkish lords that the building would instead serve as a residence for the town-priest, and added a chimney, hence its name Odžaklija (Chimney). In 1922, the Teokarevi? family opened a wool cloth factory in the small town of Vu?je near Leskovac. By 1938, the private textile factories of Leskovac town employed 2,560 workers. In the 1870s, there were thousands of hemp-processors in Leskovac, producing up to 150,000 cartloads per year. The city was once known as "Little Manchester", because of its 19th-century textile industry which was second only to that of Manchester, England. The city continued to be a major textile center until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, but due to the economic isolation of Serbia resulting from ethnic wars, its remote location, and failure to privatize the mills, the industry collapsed resulting in depression of the economy in the area.[10] From 1929 to 1941, Leskovac was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. World War II[edit] Main article: World War II in Yugoslavia WWII memorial park and “Goddess of Victory” statue During the World War II, the city was part of German-occupied Serbia. It was heavily bombed by the Allies in 1944, with estimates of civilian casualties varying from over a thousand to six thousand.[11][12] The heaviest bombing occurred on September 6, 1944 when most of the central part of the town was destroyed.[13] The date is marked annually in the city. Fitzroy Maclean the head of the British military mission to the Partisans wrote ..... as we watched the whole of Leskovac seemed to rise bodily in the air in a tornado of dust and smoke and debris, and a great rending noise fell on our ears. ..... What was left of Leskovac lay enveloped in a pall of smoke; several buildings seemed to be burning fiercely. Even the Partisans seemed subdued. This was part of Operation Ratweek to attack the enemy withdrawal, and air reconnaissance had confirmed the presence of a strong concentration of armour and motor transport there, although he said the use of 50 ‘Heavies’ or Flying Fortresses did seem rather like taking a sledge-hammer to crack a walnut..[14] Kosovo conflict[edit] Main article: Kosovo War On 12 April 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia a bridge near Leskovac (Grdeli?ka klisura) was destroyed by a NATO aircraft as a passenger train was crossing. The act was highly condemned with the bridge being struck twice (the train itself having been bombed from the first attack). Geography[edit] Leskovac is situated in the heart of the vast and fertile valley of Leskovac (50 km (31 mi) long and 45 km (28 mi) wide), the small Veternica river, at the foot of Hisar, in the central part of the Leskovac valley. Leskovac lies at an altitude of 228 meters, in a basin that covers 2,250 km2 (869 sq mi). Around the valley are mountains Radan and Pasja?a the west, Kukavica and ?emernik in the south and Babi?ka Gora, Seli?evica and Suva Planina to the east.

Agranat Commission
The Agranat Commission (Hebrew: ???? ?????) was a National Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate failings in the Israel Defense Forces in the prelude to the Yom Kippur War, when Israel was found unprepared for the Egyptian attack against the Bar Lev Line and a simultaneous attack by Syria in the Golan—the first phase in a war in which 2,812 Israeli soldiers were killed.

The Committee was headed by Shimon Agranat, Chief Justice of Israel's Supreme Court. Its other members were Justice Moshe Landau, State Comptroller Yitzchak Nebenzahl, and former Chiefs of Staff Yigael Yadin and Chaim Laskov. The Committee sat for 140 sessions, during which they listened to the testimony of 58 witnesses.[1] It was established on 21 November 1973 with a remit to investigate: The intelligence information for the days preceding the Yom Kippur War on the enemy's moves and intentions to launch the war, the evaluation of this information, and the decisions taken by the responsible military and civil authorities in response thereto. The general deployment of the IDF in case of war, its state of readiness during the days preceding the Yom Kippur War, and its operations up to the containment of the enemy.[2] It did not examine the later stages of the war when the IDF went on the offensive. On 31 December 1973, elections that had been delayed by the war took place. Likud, a new political party, won 39 seats in the Knesset. Newly elected Member of Knesset and one of the Likud founders, Reserve General Ariel Sharon gave a newspaper interview in which he was quoted as saying that he would disobey orders that he felt were against the interests of the State or his subordinates. This caused so much public concern that Sharon was asked to appear before the Commission,[3] which accepted his testimony that the quote was in the context of a specific event which occurred under very exceptional circumstances.[4] Findings[edit] The commission's report was published in three parts. The interim report, released 1 April 1974, called for the dismissal of a number of senior officers in the IDF and caused such controversy that Prime Minister Golda Meir was forced to resign. The second part was published 10 July 1974 and contained the reasons for the conclusions of the first report. The final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975.[5] One consequence of the Commission's investigation was the "Basic Law: The Army (1975)", clarifying the IDF's legal status. The Interim Report[edit] Published on 1 April 1974, the Interim Report caused a sensation. Its headline recommendation was the dismissal of four senior officers in military intelligence: The Chief of Military Intelligence Major General Eliyahu Zeira, his deputy Brigadier David (Aryeh) Shalev, the head of the Egyptian Department Lt Colonel Yona Bendman, and the chief intelligence officer in the Southern Command Lt Colonel David Gdalia.[6] The report also was critical of what it called the "concept" in military intelligence thinking. The "concept" was based on the assumption that Egypt would only attack if it had the air-power to take on the Israeli Air Force. Military intelligence also thought that Syria would only attack if Egypt did. In the absence of any upgrading of Egypt's air force, the directorate concluded there was no threat of imminent war.[7][8] This assumption led to complacency and evidence being ignored. For example, on 1 October and again on 3 October 1973, Lieutenant Benjamin Siman Yov, order of battle intelligence officer for the Southern Command, gave his superior Lt Colonel Gadalia documents indicating Egypt's war preparations.[9] In its examination of the senior echelons of the IDF, the commission also concluded that GOC Southern Command Shmuel Gonen should be dismissed. After his departure, Gonen argued that he had only been in the post for a few months and that the command had been neglected by his predecessor Ariel Sharon.[10] The Commission also found Chief of Staff Dado Elazar responsible, but it refused to give an opinion on the responsibility of the Minister of Defence Moshe Dayan, arguing that this was beyond its remit. This report caused public uproar and unhappiness in the army. In Abba Eban's words "The conclusions ... did not seem to accord with the narrative"[11] Yitzhak Rabin walked out of the cabinet with Elazar.[12] Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets.[13] Nine days after the publication of the Interim Report, Golda Meir announced the resignation of her government. After his dismissal, Elazar maintained that had he been given more of the information, he would have mobilized the IDF sooner. This only confirmed the Commissions criticisms about the reliance on a single avenue for intelligence analysis.[14][15] Elazar died two years later aged 48.[16] The Final Report[edit] The final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975. The completed report was 1,500 pages long, with 746 pages devoted to the fighting in the south and 311 to the northern front. Forty two pages were made public, the remainder being classified.[17][18] Besides the IDF's failures, it looked at the issues around civilian and political control of the army and found a "lack of clear definitions...". Surprisingly, they could not find a clear statement of civilian control over the military. They argued that the Basic Law: The Cabinet (1968) implied authority when it stated that the Cabinet has authority over all areas not covered by other legislation. Later critics argued that the Cabinet's authority stemmed from the IDF Order (1948), which authorised the Minister of Defence to set up the army. Further questions arose over hundreds of orders issued by Chiefs of Staff since 1948 without authorisation from the Minister of Defence. These discoveries led to the swift enactment of Basic Law: The Army (1975). Its main clause stated: The Army is subject to the authority of the Cabinet. The Minister responsible is the Minister of Defense. The supreme commander of the Army is the Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff is subject to the authority of Cabinet and subordinate to the Minister of Defence. The new law still left some issues unresolved, such as who appoints a Chief of Staff and whether the Chief of Staff was the most senior officer in the army. In practice, the controversy about the report's absence of criticism of Moshe Dayan led to a strengthening of the Chief of Staff's position since he could argue that if the Chief of Staff had sole responsibility, it must be the Chief of Staff's decision. The Chief of Staff was now a regular attender of cabinet meetings.[19] The Commission was critical of the standard of everyday discipline in the IDF: "Discipline is indivisible. For example, a soldier who becomes accustomed in time of peace not to observe the minor rules, such as in matters of personal appearance, without being alerted to this failure by his superior officer, will in the end be negligent in carrying out operational orders."[20] As a response to the Commission's criticism of using military intelligence as the sole route for analysis of information, the Foreign Ministry established a Research and Planning Department.[21] Despite this, five years later the 29th Comptrollers Report into the conduct of the IDF during Operation Litani, which left 21 IDF soldiers dead, concluded that conditions remained the same as in 1973. The Report's author was Yitzhak Nebenzahl, a member of the Agranat Commission.[22] The full text of the report, except for 48 pages, was made public 1 January 1995.[23] Critique of the report[edit] The findings of the Agranat Commission have been the focus of sharp debate among the Israeli public up until today. Particular criticism relates to its exoneration of the country's political leadership, especially Defense Minister Dayan. According to the Report: "As long as he accepts the opinions of his advisers, he does not bear any personal responsibility." Further criticism responds to the Commission's recommendations, stemming from the failure of military intelligence to assess the Arab states' intent, that the IDF should not consider the intentions of hostile states, but rather their capacity for war. Thirty years later, Giora Eiland, head of the National Security Council, wrote: "Both the proscription against considering intent and the concentration on the prevention of threats—two central messages of the Agranat Commission [Report]—frustrated and delayed the rebuilding and preparedness of the IDF for years."

Politics and government[edit] In the state legislature, Bishop is in the 26th Assembly District, represented by Republican Devon Mathis.[17] It is also in the 8th State Senate district. Federally, Bishop is in California's 8th congressional district, represented by Republican Paul Cook.[18] Bishop maintains its own police force (the only one in Inyo County), but also has a substation of the Inyo County Sheriff's Department on the outskirts of the city. The California Highway Patrol also has an office in town. Ambulance services are provided by Symons Ambulance. Transportation[edit] U.S. Route 395 is the main highway serving Bishop between southern California and Reno while U.S. 6 provides access to Tonopah and other communities in Nevada. The Eastern Sierra Airport provides general aviation services locally while scheduled passenger airline flights are available at Mammoth Yosemite Airport. History[edit] The Bishop Creek post office operated from 1870 to 1889 and from 1935 to 1938.[4] The first Bishop post office opened in 1889.[4] In order to support the growth aspirations of the City of Los Angeles, water was diverted from the Owens River into the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. The Owens Valley cultures and environments changed substantially. From the 1910s to 1930s the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased much of the valley for water rights and control. The economy of Bishop suffered when farmers sold their land. Jack Foley, a Bishop resident and sound effects specialist, mitigated the economic loss by persuading several Los Angeles studio bosses that the town of Bishop would be ideal as a location to shoot westerns. Notable residents[edit] The aforementioned Jack Foley is the namesake for the art of adding sound effects to films, with the profession named Foley artist. Television director and producer David Barrett also calls Bishop home, along with his brother, stuntman and NASCAR driver Stanton Barrett. They are grandsons to Dave McCoy, founder of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area. Bishop was the home of Galen Rowell, and his wife Barbara, before their death at the Eastern Sierra Regional Airport. Matt Williams, former Major League Baseball 3rd baseman and former manager of the Washington Nationals, was born in Bishop. Horace M. Albright, the second director of the National Park Service, was born in Bishop in 1890. Artist Robert Clunie lived and painted in Bishop for decades. Jill Kinmont, noted ski racer who was paralyzed in a 1955 accident, grew up in Bishop. The actor Robert Bray, who portrayed forest ranger Corey Stuart in CBS's Lassie from 1964–1968 and Simon Kane in ABC's Stagecoach West from 1960–1961, retired to Bishop, where he died in 1983 at the age of sixty-five. Former child actor Richard Eyer, who played Bray's son in Stagecoach West, was a teacher in Bishop, until he retired. Tod Griffin, a television actor from 1953 to 1961, resided in Bishop at the time of his death in 2002. Mountaineer Peter Croft lives in Bishop. Major Kern W. Dunagan US Army Medal of Honor recipient graduated from Bishop High School. Actor Trevor Donovan grew up in Bishop. Cowboy poet Curley Fletcher (1892-1954) was raised in Bishop. Major League Baseball pitcher Hal Gregg lived in Bishop until his death there in 1991. Elisha Vanslyck Cook, Jr. was a character actor in dozens of films, including The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep and Shane, who lived in Bishop until his death in Big Pine in 1995.

Metrication in New Zealand
New Zealand started metrication in 1969 with the establishment of the Metric Advisory Board (MAB) and completed metrication on 14 December 1976.[1]

New Zealand started metrication in 1969 with the establishment of the Metric Advisory Board (MAB) and completed metrication on 14 December 1976.[1] Contents 1 Strategy toward metrication 2 Current exceptions 3 References 4 External links Strategy toward metrication[edit] The New Zealand metric symbol, which can be seen to the right, was introduced in March 1971. To give metrication a human face, a baby girl whose parents agreed to co-operate was named Miss Metric.[2] News and pictures of her progress were intermingled with press releases about the progress of metrication. By the end of 1972 the temperature scale, road signs, and measures used in the sale of such items as wool and milk had been metricated. Only a few letters voiced outright opposition to the changeover.[dubious – discuss] Current exceptions[edit] Although New Zealand completed metrication in the 1970s, a study of university students undertaken in 1992 found a continued use of imperial units for birth weight and human height alongside metric units at that time.[3] The aviation industry is one of the last major users of the old imperial system: altitude and airport elevation is measured in feet. All other aspects (fuel quantity, aircraft weight, runway length, etc.) use metric.

Stefan Gavrilovi? (Serbian Cyrillic: ?????? ??????????, Sremski Karlovci, c. 1750-Sremski Karlovci, 1823) was an 18th-century-19th-century Serbian painter known best for his iconostasis and frescoes. He is considered one of the masters of Neoclassical and late Baroque paintings, and was very influenced by Jakov Orfelin and Teodor Kra?un.[1][2] Georgije Bakalovi? was one of his pupils.[3] He made many flags for the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire. He authored Mojsije Putnik's portrait, among many other paintings, icons and frescoes.

Waterproof fabric
Waterproof fabrics are fabrics that are inherently, or have been treated to become, resistant to penetration by water and wetting. The term "waterproof" refers to conformance to a governing specification[1] and specific conditions of a laboratory test method. They are usually natural or synthetic fabrics that are laminated to or coated with a waterproofing material such as rubber, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane (PU), silicone elastomer, fluoropolymers, and wax. Treatment could be either of the fabric during manufacture or of completed products after manufacture, for instance by a waterproofing spray. Examples include the rubberised fabric used in Mackintosh jackets, sauna suits and inflatable boats. They are even used for footballs and glasses.

Waterproof fabrics are fabrics that are inherently, or have been treated to become, resistant to penetration by water and wetting.

Treatment could be either of the fabric during manufacture or of completed products after manufacture, for instance by a waterproofing spray. Examples include the rubberised fabric used in Mackintosh jackets, sauna suits and inflatable boats. They are even used for footballs and glasses. The most common waterproofing treatment in the early 2000s was the application of C8 fluorocarbon-based textile finishes during manufacture.[2] However, environmental and health concerns led to a transition to C6 fluorocarbon-based finishes and the development of alternative chemistries, such as ChemStik technology, a solvent-free process involving the on-surface polymerization of hydrocarbon chains.[2] Contents 1 Definition and specifications 2 Directional fabrics 3 In combination with thermal insulation 4 Beyond clothing 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Definition and specifications[edit] Waterproof/breathable fabrics resist liquid water passing through, but allow water vapour to pass through. Their ability to block out rain and snow while allowing vapour from sweat to evaporate leads to their use in rainwear, waterproof outdoor sports clothing, tents, and other applications. Standard laboratory testing protocols[which?] define the performance of these fabrics. Water resistance is measured by the amount of water, in mm, which can be suspended above the fabric before water seeps through[citation needed]. Breathability or Moisture vapor transmission rate is measured by the rate at which water vapor passes through, in grams of water vapour per square meter of fabric per 24-hour period (g/m2/d)[citation needed], often abbreviated to just "g". In recent years [timeframe?] some[who?], but not all, sporting goods manufacturers have begun including this information on their product labels. Typical mid-range fabrics tend to have values of 5,000 mm of water resistance and 5,000 g of breathability; the best materials have 20,000 mm and 20,000 g. One specific definition of "waterproof/breathable" requires the fabric to withstand over 1,000 millimetres of water (9.8 kPa) pressure without leaking (see hydrostatic head)[citation needed]. These values should be taken with some caveats. Rain room tests show that some fabrics with less than 1,000 mm of water resistance keep water out sufficiently for practical purposes[citation needed]. Garments made from these fabrics tested in the Leeds University Rain Room show no signs of leakage after 4 hours of simulated rain five times heavier than heavy British rain. However, some garments made from fabrics that exceed 20 000 mm have leaked through zips, hoods, and seams. Pressure may not be a good measure for rainwear, as the force of the rain drop on the fabric also depends on how much the fabric moves [according to whom?]; it is a good measure for sitting on wet ground or similar situations. In addition, the breathability of nearly all waterproof/breathable fabrics is very dependent upon weather conditions, especially temperature, humidity and wind [according to whom?]. Directional fabrics[edit] Fabric construction which directs water away from the body, rather than membranes, coatings or laminates, can be used to keep the wearer dry. This means that perspiration can be moved away from the body more effectively, as both liquid water and water vapour can be directed. These are directional fabrics such as Nikwax Analogy and FurTech, which are also breathable in the conventional sense (although these examples are actually a combination of two different fabrics, a directional "pump" layer underneath a distinct windproof and water resistant outer layer, and while effectively completely waterproof against rain they would fail a strict hydrostatic head test as given in the definition above). In combination with thermal insulation[edit] Garments that combine waterproofing with some thermal insulation, such as those manufactured by FurTech and Nikwax Analogy, resist cold bridging, heat transferred through layers of poorly-thermally-insulating materials in close contact that would be prevented by a small airspace. When there is cold bridging, vapour on the dry side can condense on the cold surface, making it appear that the thin waterproof breathable fabric has leaked. Beyond clothing[edit] Not all waterproof fabrics are used for clothing-- the demand for stain and waterproof fabrics is also high in the upholstery industry, where product like Crypton find frequent application on sofas, chairs, and pillows. Their waterproof nature also makes them highly resistant to bacteria, making them suitable for settings like hospitals as well.

Xihoumen Bridge
The Xihoumen Bridge (simplified Chinese: ?????; traditional Chinese: ?????) is a suspension bridge built on the Zhoushan Archipelago, the largest offshore island group in China. The main span was completed in December 2007. [1] The entire bridge, along with Jintang Bridge, was opened to traffic on a test basis on 25 December 2009. [2] It is the second-longest suspension bridge ranked by the length of the centre span. The opening date was put off because of a ship collision on 16 November 2009 that slightly damaged the side of Jintang Bridge.

The main span was completed in December 2007. [1] The entire bridge, along with Jintang Bridge, was opened to traffic on a test basis on 25 December 2009. [2] It is the second-longest suspension bridge ranked by the length of the centre span. The opening date was put off because of a ship collision on 16 November 2009 that slightly damaged the side of Jintang Bridge. The Xihoumen Bridge under construction (2007) The 5.3-kilometre-long suspension bridge connection has a 2.6-kilometre-long main bridge with a central span of 1,650 metres. The approaches total 2.7 kilometres. When it opened, there was only one bridge with a larger span, the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Japan. The bridge was built by the province of Zhejiang, at a cost of 2.48 billion yuan (approximately US$363 million). Construction began in 2005, and the first traffic crossed the bridge on 25 December 2009, at 11:58 p.m., local time. The Xihoumen Bridge links Jintang and Cezi islands.

PZL TS-11 Iskra
The PZL TS-11 Iskra (English: Spark) is a Polish jet trainer aircraft, used by the air forces of Poland and India. It is notable as the main training aircraft of the Polish Air Force, and as the oldest jet aircraft still in service in Poland.

It is notable as the main training aircraft of the Polish Air Force, and as the oldest jet aircraft still in service in Poland. Contents 1 Development 2 Design 3 Operational history 4 Variants 5 Operator 5.1 Former Operators 6 Specifications (Iskra bis D) 7 See also 8 References 8.1 Noyes 8.2 Bibliography 9 External links Development[edit] TS-11 Iskra bis B - front view The aircraft was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement for a jet trainer. The main designer was Tadeusz So?tyk - hence a designation letters TS. The new aircraft was the first jet aircraft designed in Poland. Work started in 1957, the first prototype powered by an imported British Armstrong Siddeley Viper 8 of 7.80 kN (1,750 lbf) was flown on 5 February 1960. The next two prototypes, with a Polish copy of the Viper engine named the WSK HO-10 engine were flown in March and July 1961. The new Aircraft fulfilled requirements and, after tests, was accepted for the Polish Air Force as the TS-11 Iskra bis A, produced since 1963. From about 1966, the aircraft were produced with a new Polish-designed engine WSK SO-1 with thrust of 9.80 kN (2,200 lbf). From 1969, WSK SO-3 engines with longer time between overhauls were used and later improved version WSK SO-3W with thrust of 10.80 kN (2,425 lbf). Design[edit] TS-11 Iskra bis B All-metal jet trainer aircraft, conventional in layout, with mid-wings. Wings are trapezoid-shaped, with leading edge swept at small angle. Air intakes in wings. Single jet engine has an exhaust under a boom with tail fin, which gives the aircraft an unusual silhouette. The two crewmen have ejector seats. The aircraft has no radar (apart from the TS-11R). It can be fitted with photo cameras. Poland is currently developing the new TS-11S Iskra (Spark) for future jet trainer. It will be equipped with new avionics, strengthened structures and a more powerful engine. Operational history[edit] HUD mounted in PZL TS-11F Iskra (MSPO 2008). TS-11 Iskra MR of Bia?o-Czerwone Iskry aerobatic team In 1964, the TS-11 prototype beat four world records in its class, among others the speed record of 839 km/h (524 mph). The Iskra competed as the standard jet trainer for the Warsaw Pact, but lost out to the Czechoslovak plane Aero L-29 Delfín. Poland became the only Warsaw pact country to use the Iskra. A total of 424 aircraft were built by 1987, when production ceased. A total of 50 aircraft Iskra bis D were exported to India in 1975, then further 26 in the 1990s. In 2002, Poland still had 110 TS-11s, including 5 TS-11Rs. The Iskra became Polish first and only jet trainer so far - the programme for a successor, the PZL I-22 Iryda (later designated M-93 Iryda), failed for several reasons and few were built. In Indian service, Iskra was withdrawn by 16 December 2004. During service, seven were lost, killing four crew. In 2013, Poland had 30 (total number of school aircraft: TS-11, PZL-130) operational Iskras'[1] From 1969 TS-11s have been used by the Polish aerobatics team, initially called "Rombik", and currently "Bia?o-Czerwone Iskry" ("White-and-Red Sparks"). The UK has one fully operational ground running TS-11 Iskra (1018) which is part of the Cold War Jets Collection a museum based at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, Leicestershire.

It had a camera in the lower fuselage and increased fuel capacity. Only 5 were built in 1972, in 1983 were converted to trainers. TS-11 Iskra bis D / TS-11 Iskra 200 SB Two-seat jet trainer aircraft from 1973. Fifty of those aircraft were built for the Indian Air Force with bigger payload. TS-11 Iskra bis DF Two-seat trainer-reconnaissance aircraft from 1974. It can carry armament, plus three cameras. TS-11 Iskra R Two-seat naval reconnaissance aircraft, equipped with a surveillance radar, RDS-81. Six aircraft converted in 1991. TS-11 Iskra BR 200 Single-seat attack and reconnaissance aircraft prototype from 1972, did not enter production. TS-11 Iskra MR TS-11 with modernized avionics according to ICAO standards and operated in the Bia?o-Czerwone Iskry aerobatics team since 1998. TS-11 Iskra Jet / TS-11 Spark After being withdrawn from service, it was disarmed and sold to private users in the United States, Australia and others countries as a warbird valued for its double seats and easy handling.

Anne Abbott
Anne Wales Abbott or, Abbot (April 10, 1808 – June 1, 1908) was a game designer, magazine editor, literary reviewer, and author.
Anna Wales Abott Born (1808-04-10)April 10, 1808 Died June 1, 1908(1908-06-01) (aged 100) Cambridge, Massachusetts Nationality American Other names Abbot Occupation Game Designer, Magazine Editor Anne Wales Abbott or, Abbot (April 10, 1808 – June 1, 1908) was a game designer, magazine editor, literary reviewer, and author. Life[edit] Abbott was born 10 April 1808, the daughter of Reverend Abiel Abbott, a Beverly, Massachusetts clergyman, and Eunice Abbott.[1][2] Abbott (sic) designed the hugely popular card game Dr. Busby, which was published by W. & S. B. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts on March 7, 1843.[3] It sold 15,000 copies in its first eighteen months[4] Abbot authored her second game The Racers which was sold in Salem, Mass. through J. P. Jewett on January 13, 1844.[5] The Racers was not published by W. & S. B. Ives as it is not advertised with other published W. & S. B. Ives games in her book, DOCTOR BUSBY AND HIS NEIGHBORS which was typeset by November 24, 1844[6][7] but not released for sale until December 28, 1844.[8] She released her third game Master Rodbury, September 14, 1844.[9] This time she again used W. & S. B. Ives as the publisher.[10] Abbot published her first book, WILLIE ROGERS sometime before November 24, 1844,[6][7] quickly followed by her second book, DOCTOR BUSBY AND HIS NEIGHBORS on December 28, 1844.[8] Before 1991 Anne Wales Abbot was credited for authoring The Mansion of Happiness board game which was released by W. & S. B. Ives on November 24, 1843.[6] The Mansion of Happiness was originally released in England in 1800,[11] and authored by George W. M. Fox.[11] She may have collaborated with S. B. (Stephen Bradshaw) Ives, but neither Anne nor Stephen, authored the W. & S. B. Ives published version which was an almost exact copy of the English game. Before 1992 Abbot was credited for authoring the extremely long lasting card game of Authors which was published in 1861 by A. Augustus Smith of G. M. Whipple and A. A. Smith. They were also publishers in Salem, Mass. but the publishing house was one block away from the original W. & S. B. Ives bookstore at 230 Essex Street. That bookstore and publishing house, 232 Essex Street were now owned by Henry P. Ives, S. B. Ives son. Actually, the game of Authors was invented by "a coterie of bright young ladies" of Salem and presented by a gentleman to A. Augustus Smith for publication.[12][13] By 1861, Anne Abbot would have been in her fifties, not fitting the description of the designers of Authors. In July 1850, Abbott reviewed Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter for the North American Review, declaring she liked the preface better than the tale. Abbott disapproved of Hawthorne's subject matter and believed he had allowed his good judgement to be carried away by "the magic power of the style." Hawthorne referred to Abbott as one of that "damned mob of scribbling women."[14] Abbott served gratuitously as editor (1851–1858) of The Child's Friend, a literary journal for young people. Profits from the publication were directed to the relief of indigent and neglected children.[15][16] In 1853, Abbott's Autumn Leaves: Original Pieces in Prose and Verse was published by John Bartlett of Cambridge. Children's books by Abbott include Doctor Busby and His Neighbors, Kate and Lizzie, or Six Months Out of School, Lost Wheelbarrow and Other Stories, and The Tamed and the Untamed and Other Stories. Abbott died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1 June 1908.[1] References[edit] ^ a b Brown, Darren, Curator of Collections. Beverly Historical Society & Museum.

She studied medicine in Germany, before returning to Namibia in 1989 to complete a medical internship. She later returned to Germany, to specialise in ophthalmology at the University of Leipzig.[4] She is married, and has one son.[4] Work in Namibia[edit] In 1995, Dr Ndume was introduced to Surgical Eye Expeditions International, and set about starting a project in Namibia. In August 1997, the first eye camp was held at Rundu, Kavango Region. Currently, four or five eye camps are held each year in different locations.[4] Work with the Namibia Red Cross Society[edit] For six years, from 2001 to 2007, Dr Ndume was vice chairperson of the Namibia Red Cross Society.[5] In 2009, Dr Ndume was honoured with a humanitarian award by the NRCS for her work in restoring sight to those blinded by cataracts.[3] Work with SEE International[edit] Dr. Ndume has volunteered with sight-restoring nonprofit SEE International since 1995. Since then, SEE and Dr. Ndume have collaborated to hold free week-long eye clinics in Namibia, typically twice every year. These clinics provide free eye surgeries for approximately 300 impoverished men, women, and children.[6] International Recognition and Awards[edit] Dr. Helena Ndume and Jorge Fernando Branco Sampaio of Portugal, became the first recipients of the United Nations Nelson Mandela Prize on 22 June 2015.

Geography of the Gaelic Games
The two dominant sports of the Gaelic Games can be found to be played in traditional regions of Ireland. Hurling is traditionally found to be played mainly in the provinces of Munster and Leinster whereas Gaelic football is played in almost every county but is dominant in Ulster and Connacht and certain parts of the other provinces.

(March 2015) The dominant Gaelic Games sport in each county The two dominant sports of the Gaelic Games can be found to be played in traditional regions of Ireland. Hurling is traditionally found to be played mainly in the provinces of Munster and Leinster whereas Gaelic football is played in almost every county but is dominant in Ulster and Connacht and certain parts of the other provinces. Contents 1 Munster 2 Leinster 3 Connacht 4 Ulster 5 Links 6 See also 7 References Munster[edit] The traditional hurling-football divide in Munster runs a line from Tubber in north County Clare through Corofin to Labasheeda. Across the Shannon in County Limerick the line divides the footballing territory in the hilly west Limerick to the hurling territory in the lush lowlands of east and central Limerick. In County Cork the line also divides east to west starting at Mallow extending downwards towards Cork city and onto the coast, further west beyond the footballing west Cork is the almost entirely footballing territory in County Kerry with only a very small hurling region north of Tralee in Ardfert, Ballyheigue and Causeway. The entire Counties of Tipperary and Waterford are considered to be traditionally hurling regions.[1] Leinster[edit] In Leinster the traditionally hurling region is located to the south west of the province. The entire of County Kilkenny is considered hurling territory with very little football activity. Most of County Wexford is in the hurling region along with Counties Carlow, Laois and Offaly. The rest of the Leinster Counties are considered footballing counties. Connacht[edit] Connacht is almost entirely Gaelic football territory with only Galway competing in the Liam MacCarthy Cup. In County Galway the hurling-football divide draws a line from Galway City to Ballinasloe. The divide in Galway probably stands out more than the other counties. The hurling territory in Galway stands out so strongly from the rest of the province which results in the Galway team playing in the Leinster Championship. Another very small hurling region is in eastern County Mayo around Ballyhaunis. Ulster[edit] Similar to Connacht, Ulster is almost entirely a footballing region with the hurling region being located in the Glens of Antrim.[2] Links[edit] Gaelic Athletic Association county Gaelic Games Hurling Football Galway GAA Dual county See also[edit] Gaelic games portal References[edit] ^ http://www.stsylvesters.ie/feb02news/the-geography-of-hurling-1-1 ^ http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/sports-recreation/sport/wexford-hurling/the-geography-of-hurling/the-present-hurling-regio/ This Gaelic games-related article is a stub.

Theta Tau
Theta Tau (??) is an engineering fraternity. As defined by the fraternity, "The purpose of Theta Tau is to develop and maintain a high standard of professional interest among its members, and to unite them in a strong bond of fraternal fellowship." The goals of the fraternity are to promote the social and professional development of its members during and after their college years. Today, Theta Tau is the oldest and largest professional engineering fraternity in the United States, with a diverse membership of men and women studying engineering at more than 40 campuses. It was founded in 1904 by four engineering students at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

They agreed that character qualifications should have top priority in membership selection. The Fraternity fulfilled the dream of its principal founder, Erich Schrader, that there be established in engineering a fraternity similar to those already existing in law, medicine, and dentistry. Founder Schrader established a record of service unequaled in the Fraternity's history. He served as its first Grand Regent until 1919, and then for 35 years as Grand Scribe. At its Founders' Golden Anniversary Convention (1954), Theta Tau established the position of Counselor to be held only by him. His unselfish service continued until his death in 1962, at the age of 81. The other founders also maintained their interest in the Fraternity throughout their lives. The last, Brother Vinal, died in 1971. Brother Schrader was chiefly responsible for the Ritual, Constitution, and the Bylaws adopted by the founders. The first badge was a gold skull with the letters ? and ? on its forehead, and a crossed hammer and tongs beneath. The Constitution provided for the establishment of additional chapters at other leading engineering schools, and the Fraternity soon began to take on its national character. Founder Hanks spoke of Theta Tau to his friend, Robert Downing, a member of the Rhombohedron Club at Michigan College of Mines; after correspondence and an inspection trip by Brother Hanks, the club (established in 1903) was installed as Beta Chapter in 1906. The oldest symbol of the fraternity still in use is the coat of arms adopted in 1906. It may only be displayed or worn by members. Founder Lewis transferred to the Colorado School of Mines and there made contact with the Square Set Club which became Gamma Chapter in 1907. The Southwestern Alumni Association, the fraternity's first, was established in Douglas, Arizona, in 1908. In 1911, representatives of the three chapters and the alumni association met at the University of Minnesota for the first national convention, the name was changed to Theta Tau, a revised ritual approved, and the present badge adopted. Perhaps most important for its future expansion, it was decided that Theta Tau would include all branches of engineering. Pre-World War II growth (1911-1935)[edit] In the next two years, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta Chapters were installed. The Second Convention was held in Houghton, Michigan, in 1913. That Convention designated The Gear of Theta Tau as the national fraternity's magazine and appointed Jack E. Haynes, A '08, as its first editor-in-chief. Previously, the magazine had been published by Beta Chapter with Herman H. Hopkins, B '08, as editor. Brother Hopkins, a member of the Rhombohedron Club, had been initiated by Beta Chapter as an alumnus. He served until 1919 as the Grand Scribe, and later (1935) was elected Grand Regent. The Third Convention (1915) and the Fourth (1919) were held in Cleveland, Ohio. Meanwhile, Theta, Iota, and Kappa Chapters were installed; and the Fraternity was well established. Elected as Grand Regent in 1919 was Dr. George D. Louderback, E '96, a charter member of Epsilon Chapter. During his tenure, rapid growth continued, with nine more chapters being installed. J. Sidney Marine, H '21, was elected Grand Regent in 1925, the youngest one to serve in that position. In 1926, Donald D. Curtis, O Hon. '19, was appointed editor. He reorganized the magazine and established membership files still in use. He later (1950-1952) served as Grand Regent. Three more chapters were installed during the terms of Grand Regent Dr. Richard J. Russell, E '19. He designed and issued the first 5,000 membership certificates and also designed the officer robes. Joseph W. Howe, O '24, and Paul L. Mercer, O '21, became Editors of The Gear in 1929 and for 32 years diligently maintained regular semiannual publication despite economic conditions. Fred Coffman, L '22, served as Grand Regent during the depression years through 1935. Despite the conditions, three more chapters were installed. A period of very conservative extension began during the thirties with charters generally being granted only to petitioning long-established locals. World War II history (1935-1944)[edit] Regional Conferences were established during Brother Hopkins' term as Grand Regent (1935–37). Dr. John M. Daniels, N Hon. '22, was the last to serve out his term as Grand Regent in the pre-World War II period. At the 1939 Convention, Russell G. Glass, S '24, the first of two charter members of Sigma Chapter to serve in the Fraternity's top position, was elected Grand Regent, and reelected in 1941. In 1940, Grand Regent Glass made a nationwide tour visiting nearly every chapter and many alumni associations. At the 1941 Convention, Theta Tau began its tradition of honoring a student chapter delegate as the convention's "Outstanding Delegate." Because of World War II, Conventions were discontinued and chapters were reduced in size, but few went inactive during this period. Brother Hopkins was named Acting Grand Regent for the 27-month period that Grand Regent Glass served abroad in the Navy. When Conventions were resumed in 1946, Ralph W. Nusser, Z '28, was elected Grand Regent. During his term, the chapters were unusually large due to the influx of returning veterans. Norman B. Ames, GB '17, the charter member responsible for Gamma Beta Chapter's affiliation with Theta Tau, was elected Grand Regent in 1948. He was later to succeed Founder Schrader as Grand Scribe. Post World War II (1944-1962)[edit] Donald D. Curtis, who a few months after his initiation into the fraternity had been appointed Editor in 1926, climaxed his years of continuous service as a national officer with his term as Grand Regent beginning in 1950. Another longtime Fraternity officer, Jamison Vawter, Z '16, was elected Grand Regent for the term concluding Theta Tau's first half century. He had served for 27 years as Grand Treasurer and was honored by being the first for whom a Theta Tau Convention was named (1935). The Founders' Golden Anniversary Convention was held in Minneapolis, scheduled to include Founders' Day. It was a gala occasion marred only by the absence of Founder Schrader and Editor Howe due to illness. It was attended by Founders Lewis and Vinal, and by many Past Grand Regents, including Brother Louderback. A. Dexter Hinckley, T '25, was elected Grand Regent at the 1954 Convention. During his first term, Brother Ames, newly elected Grand Scribe, resigned to accept a Fulbright Lectureship in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). On his return, he visited schools as Special Representative of the Executive Council to promote extension. The position of Regional Director was established by the 1956 Convention. At the 1958 Convention, Charles W. Britzius, A '33, was elected Grand Regent, the restriction of membership to those who were white was removed, and the Fraternity appropriated funds to support extension efforts. Robert E. Pope, Z '52, appointed Grand Scribe in April, 1956, to succeed Brother Ames, and repeatedly elected to that office for 38 years, was first employed by the fraternity as Travelling Secretary in October, 1959. Brother William E. Franklin, Z '57, then assistant editor, was appointed editor-in-chief of The Gear in 1961, succeeding Brothers Howe and Mercer. He served until 1969. Vietnam years (1962-1976)[edit] At the convention in 1962, William K. Rey, M '45, was elected Grand Regent, and the fraternity established the position of Executive Secretary (now Executive Director) to which Brother Pope was appointed. In 1963, for the first time, the fraternity had a central office. Brother Britzius, retiring as Grand Regent, was elected Grand Treasurer, a position he was to hold for twelve years. The decade of the 1960s was one of moderate growth with seven new chapters installed. Annual alumni gifts, now so important to the fraternity, were first solicited in 1964. The convention in 1964 adopted the colony program as the standard route which a local fraternity would follow in becoming a Theta Tau Chapter. It also adopted the official flag featuring four quadrants - dark red in upper left with the coat of arms and lower right with stepped gold letters "??." The other two quadrants are gold. The four items of official jewelry remain the member's badge, gear pin (called "sister pin" until 1994), pledge insignia, and official recognition button. Other insignia have been adopted over the years. The colony program sparked design of the simple colony pin, and colony pledge pin, and contributed to adoption of an alternative flag divided along its length into three equal sections, the left and right dark red with gold in the center bearing dark red letters ? and ? arranged vertically. Other jewelry items are the Greek letter and coat of arms recognition buttons, alumni charm, and Greek letter lavaliere. The coat of arms is also available as a tie tac, in "Founders' size," on a ring, cuff links, and the "annual award key." Available since 1989 is the identification pin displaying the crest (hand grasping hammer and tongs) and gear wheels with the member's name, chapter, and year engraved on its face. To this may be attached an engraved bar for each Theta Tau national meeting attended by the member. The 1966 Convention elected C. Ramond Hanes, '24, another Sigma charter member, as Grand Regent. The 1968 Convention elected Dr. Charles E. Wales, '53, an Epsilon Beta charter member, as Grand Regent. The position of Student Member of the Executive Council was created in 1970. The Executive Council Bulletin, in newsletter format, was first published during the 1970-72 biennium. Now generally issued monthly during the school year, it provides timely news and reminders to officers of the national Fraternity, chapters, and alumni organizations. F. Garn Hatch, ZB '56, edited the Fall 1970, issue of The Gear, the first issue with 8-1/2x11-inch page size. He was succeeded by James M. Walter, Phi '68, who served through 1975, and then Steven A. Williams, LB '73, editor-in-chief, through 1977. During this period the page size returned to 7x10 inches. Dr. George G. Dodd, Z '60, was elected Grand Regent in 1972; and the Delegate-at-Large (immediate Past Grand Regent) was made officially a member of the Executive Council. The 1976 Convention elected as Grand Regent Stephen J. Barth, LB '67, a charter member of Lambda Beta Chapter, the first second-generation Theta Tau to hold this position. In 1977, a plan adopted by the 1976 Convention was implemented, making women eligible for membership with Delta chapter at Case Western Reserve, being one of the first to actually admit women. A new era (1976-1991)[edit] Returning to the tradition of editors-in-chief from Omicron Chapter, Richard A. Rummelhart, O '76, was appointed to this position in 1978 and was succeeded by Arthur T. Petrzelka, O '79, who edited the magazine 1979-88. With the Spring, 1979, issue, The Gear adopted the standard 8-1/2x11-inch page size which has been continued. The first membership directory in forty years was published in 1979, and others in 1985, 1990, and 1994. A History of Theta Tau, compiled by Past Grand Regent Charles W. Britzius, was published in 1980. Regional Conferences were replaced by a special Convention in 1981, establishing the pattern of holding national meetings annually in August rather than biennially in the week after Christmas. In 1982, A. Thomas Brown, M '77, like Brother Barth, a member's son, was elected Grand Regent. During 1983, Theta Tau purchased its first computer; moved the central office from the Executive Secretary's home to space in the Theta Xi Memorial Headquarters Building in the St. Louis suburb of Creve Coeur; held its first National Conference; and first employed a second member, Dean W. Bettinger, T '81, as Extension Director/Chapter Consultant. Since then, others have been employed for limited periods, including Michael T. Abraham, EB '92, who served as administrative assistant in 1988 and briefly in 1989. The Theta Tau Alumni Hall of Fame was established in 1986 to honor those members of the Fraternity who have distinguished themselves through the excellence of their contributions to their professions and/or to the fraternity. Being nominated is itself a distinct honor since a chapter or the Executive Council may nominate no more than two annually. From among the nominees, the Selection Committee may name no more than five to be inducted at the national meeting each year. Beginning with the Founders, a total of sixty-three have been inducted over the years (twenty-one of them posthumously). Each laureate is presented with a plaque, and his name is engraved on a large plaque displayed in the central office and at each national meeting. Randall J. Scheetz, O '79, was first elected Grand Regent in 1986. The fraternity experienced significant growth during his tenure with the installation of eight chapters and the certification of thirteen colonies. This extension effort was sparked by Jerome R. Palardy, EB '90, (then Student Member of the Executive Council) in the Detroit area (Xi Beta, Omicron Beta, and Phi Beta Chapters resulting, the latter installed in 1991). Highlighting extension at other schools was the reestablishment of Pi and Gamma Beta Chapters (inactive since the late 1970s). Other chapters installed were Pi Beta, Rho Beta, Sigma Beta, and Tau Beta; and four new alumni clubs were authorized. The Rube Goldberg Machine Contest originated at Purdue University in 1949 as a competition between Phi Chapter of Theta Tau and Triangle held annually until 1956. Phi Chapter revived the contest in 1983 as a competition open to all Purdue students. From 1988 to 2013, the Theta Tau Rube Goldberg Machine Contest was a national competition held at Purdue University in March each year with participation by winning entries from local competitions sponsored by Theta Tau Chapters across the nation. The national contest gained much coverage by the press and television media. Sean Donnelly, T'88, and Lawrence El-Hindi, T '87, were appointed co-editors-in-chief of The Gear of Theta Tau in 1988. At the direction of the Executive Council, the Central Office staff assumed responsibility for the regular publication of the magazine beginning with the Spring 1994, issue. In 1996, the Executive Council appointed as the Board of Editors, Robert E. Pope, editor-in-chief, and Michael T. Abraham. Although it had remained nominally a semiannual periodical, for a variety of reasons its publication had sometimes been irregular during the previous quarter century. Dean W. Bettinger, who had served as a staff member in 1983, was first elected Grand Regent at the 1990 Convention and subsequently reelected in 1992 and 1994. During his tenure, nine chapters were installed: Upsilon Beta, Phi Beta, Chi Beta, Psi Beta, Tau (reestablished), Omega Beta, Delta Gamma, Epsilon Gamma, and Zeta Gamma; and six colonies certified. The Theta Tau Outstanding Student Member Program was inaugurated to provide the mechanism by which each chapter could designate its outstanding student member for recognition by the national fraternity. The criterion for selection is service to the fraternity (at any level) during the previous calendar year. The national fraternity provides an engrossed certificate and an award dangle which the recipient displays on his badge's guard chain. One of these each year is selected as the fraternity's Outstanding Student Member with the announcement made at the national meeting. The national honoree is presented with a special certificate and with a jeweled dangle. The award was first presented in 1991 for service to the fraternity during the calendar year 1990. The present day (1991-present)[edit] In 1991, the central office moved to the 655 Office Building in the Creve Coeur Executive Office Park. Michael T. Abraham returned as a permanent staff member with the title Assistant Executive Director in 1992 and was elected Grand Scribe in 1994. In 1994, the appointive position of Executive Director was added to the Executive Council. Brother Pope who had served on the Fraternity's staff for 37 years retired in 1996 and was designated Executive Director Emeritus by the Executive Council. Brother Abraham was appointed Executive Director. Lee C. Haas, Rho '62, was elected Grand Regent in 1996 and reelected in 1998. He was instrumental in establishing the Theta Tau Educational Foundation in 1998 and served as its first President. In 1999 the foundation sponsored the fraternity's first Leadership Academy replacing the National Conference. He presided at the installation of Eta Gamma, Theta Gamma, and Iota Gamma Chapters. At the fraternity's first convention held in Arizona, Glen A. Wilcox, Omega '90, was elected Grand Regent. At the 2000 meeting, many structural changes were made in the constitution and bylaws to more fully integrate the central office into the laws. These changes reflected many practices already in place and allowed the Executive Council to focus on its responsibilities as the fraternity's Board of Directors. The convention also endorsed without dissent and without modification the national fraternity liability insurance standard adopted by the Executive Council in the Spring 1999. In 2000, past Grand Regent Haas presided at the installation of Kappa Gamma Chapter at the Virginia Commonwealth University. VCU had begun its engineering school in 1996 with 92 students, and a Theta Tau Colony was established with the assistance of eleven brothers, including Brother Lee Haas and Brother Michael Livingston. Grand Regent Wilcox presided at the installation of Lambda Gamma at Clemson University on January 13, 2001, and he later presided at the installations of Mu Gamma and Nu Gamma in the spring of 2003. In November 2001, the central office moved from the St. Louis metropolitan area to Austin, Texas, and the fraternity's archives were moved from a room in the Alpha Chapter House to the central office. As the fraternity reached its Centennial in 2004, Theta Tau had initiated over 30,000 members and had more active student chapters than at any time in its history. At the 2004 Convention, Michael D. Livingston, Gamma Beta '92, was elected Grand Regent. During his terms, Omicron Gamma, Pi Gamma, Rho Gamma, Sigma Gamma, Tau Gamma, Upsilon Gamma, Phi Gamma, Chi Gamma, Psi Gamma, Omega Gamma, Zeta Delta, Eta Delta, Theta Delta, and Iota Delta chapters were installed. Additionally, Kappa, Epsilon, and Epsilon Delta, Pi Delta were re-installed /installed as a result of dedicated and persistent efforts of Steven Choi, Zeta '05. In 2007, the central office moved from leased office space to its first fraternity-owned headquarters. The roughly 1,500-square-foot (140 m2) office condo is located at the corner of 11th and San Jacinto within blocks of the capitol and university in downtown Austin. In the same year, the National Alumni Club of Theta Tau was created and work began on keeping interested alumni active and involved in support of both the Fraternity and the Theta Tau Educational Foundation. In 2009, Grand Vice Regent Justin G. Wiseman, Xi Beta '95, championed the concept of Chapter Advisory Teams to provide greater local support for each chapter by utilizing more alumni in support of respective chapters. These teams commonly consist of a faculty, house corporation, mature alumni, and recently graduated alumni advisers. In the spring of 2010, Grand Marshal Brandon Satterwhite, ?u '98, led a group of students and alumni on the Fraternity's first national service project with the Habitat for Humanity chapter in Bonnell, Florida. Late in 2010, Allison Pollard, ?au ?eta '05 (who has served as Gear Editor since 2008) created a Theta Tau Style Guide to counsel chapters on appropriate, proper, and attractive uses of Theta Tau's name, letters, and symbols in print and online. In late 2010, the Central Office began a major data migration that will enable greater remote oversight and tracking by volunteer leaders. This transition represented the most extensive technological change since 1983 (first computerization) with less significant changes having been made in 1991 (Unix-based) and 2000 (PC-based). As 2011 began, numerous additional colonies were established. The Fraternity's strong rate of growth continued—based on strategic mission, balanced program of professional development, community service, and brotherhood, strict cost controls over expenses and student fees/dues that have remained unchanged for the longest period in Theta Tau's history, the dedicated work of a growing body of Fraternity and Foundation volunteer leaders, and the everyday kind, caring, and generous expressions of brotherhood offered by our student members to others. Conventions[edit] The purpose of the biennial National Convention is to bring together brothers from all chapters together to work out the business of the fraternity. Since 1999, the Leadership Academy of the Theta Tau Educational Foundation has replaced the odd-year national conferences.

Penn was found dead in his condominium on January 24, 2006, at the age of 40. An autopsy revealed the primary cause for his death was "nonspecific cardiomyopathy" (heart disease).[1][2] Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 3 Death 4 Filmography 5 References 6 External links Early life[edit] Penn was born in Los Angeles, California, the youngest of three boys born to Leo Penn, an actor and director, and Eileen Ryan (née Annucci), an actress. His paternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Lithuania and Russia,[3] and his mother was a Roman Catholic of Italian and Irish descent.[4] According to Penn's mother, Leo Penn may have had distant Sephardic ancestry, as the family's surname was originally "Piñón".[4] His brothers are actor Sean Penn and musician Michael Penn. Career[edit] Penn started acting at the age of 12 at the Loft Studio and made his film debut in 1979’s Charlie and the Talking Buzzard, starring Christopher Hanks. In 1983, he was featured in Francis Ford Coppola’s youth drama Rumble Fish and appeared in the high school football drama All the Right Moves as the best friend of Tom Cruise's character. He also appeared in the hit dance movie Footloose in 1984 as the best friend of Kevin Bacon's character; played a villain in the Clint Eastwood western Pale Rider (1985); and co-starred with his brother Sean Penn and mother Eileen Ryan in At Close Range (1986). Penn was typically cast as a tough character, featured as a villain or a working-class lug, or in a comic role. Two of his more memorable performances were in Reservoir Dogs as Nice Guy Eddie and True Romance as Nicky Dimes (both characters in scripts written by Quentin Tarantino). In 1996 he won the award for Best Supporting Actor at the Venice Film Festival for The Funeral. In 1990, Chris was cast in a season one episode of The Young Riders. He appeared as a villain and was killed by Josh Brolin's character William Hickok. Penn, who had a black belt in karate, appeared in the 1989 motion picture Best of the Best as Travis Brickley, a cocky member of the U.S. Taekwondo team taking on the team from Korea. The film also starred James Earl Jones, Sally Kirkland, Eric Roberts, Phillip Rhee, and Simon Rhee. Penn reprised his role in 1993's Best of the Best 2. In Robert Altman's ensemble film Short Cuts, Penn played a troubled swimming pool cleaner who is disturbed by his wife's profession (a telephone sex worker who takes calls from clients at home) to which Penn's character is sometimes obliged to listen. He also appeared as a fall guy in a criminal conspiracy in Murder by Numbers, alongside Sandra Bullock. Penn was meant to appear in American Pie 2 as Steve Stifler's father, but the scenes featuring him were eventually cut as there was insufficient time to include him in the film's plot. However, they appeared on the deleted scene reel from the movie's DVD. In 2001, Penn co-starred opposite Peter Berg as the mafia brothers of Corky in Corky Romano. In 2003, he appeared on the Will & Grace episode, "Fanilow", as Barry Manilow's tour director and a character who is interested romantically in Will. Penn was featured in an episode of the television crime drama Law & Order: Criminal Intent ("Death Roe") during the 2004–2005 season. He was also featured on the 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas as the voice of Officer Eddie Pulaski. Penn played himself on a 2005 episode of the HBO series Entourage. He appeared in The Darwin Awards, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival one day after his death. Penn appears in Jay-Z's "Can I Get A..." music video as a bartender who mixes drinks and dances. Death[edit] Penn was found dead in his Santa Monica condominium on January 24, 2006, aged 40. Although Penn had used multiple drugs in the past, an autopsy performed by a Los Angeles County medical examiner revealed the primary cause of death was "nonspecific cardiomyopathy" (heart disease), with the prescription drug promethazine with codeine and an enlarged heart due to obesity being possible contributing circumstances. The toxicology report revealed that valium, morphine, marijuana and an elevated level of codeine were found in his bloodstream. Penn appeared slim and fit throughout the 1980s in movies such as Footloose, At Close Range and Pale Rider, but gained considerable weight throughout the 1990s. Sean Penn has said publicly in a TV interview on Larry King Live that his brother probably died because of his weight.[5] There is conflicting information about Penn's age at the time of death, with some obituaries giving 1962 as his year of birth.[6] In Richard T. Kelly's book, Sean Penn: His Life and Times (2004), Penn's mother indicated that his date of birth was October 10, 1965.[7] He is interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.[8] Filmography[edit] Charlie and the Talking Buzzard (1979) All the Right Moves (1983) Rumble Fish (1983) The Wild Life (1984) Footloose (1984) Pale Rider (1985) At Close Range (1986) Made in U.S.A.

This number is scheduled to increase as hundreds of new homes will be built in and around Harkstede as part of the "Meerstad Project" of the City of Groningen. Contents 1 History 2 Sightseeing 3 References 4 External links History[edit] Harkstede was supposedly founded during the 13th century, when the tower next to the local church was built. The name is probably derived from "Arkes Stee", meaning "place for a ark = church". The present church was constructed between 1692 and 1700 on the foundations of the medieval church. Planned by Henric Piccardt (1636-1712), lord of the manors of Klein Martijn at Harkstede and the Fraeylemaborg at Slochteren, it was built by two master craftsmen from the city of Groningen, Henric Coeur and Geert van der Aa. Until 1821, Harkstede was an independent municipality. That year it was annexed by Slochteren. Sightseeing[edit] Attractions include the recreation park "Gruno Park" and the international rowing course to the north of the village. For waterski enthusiasts, there is the Gruno Lake and Beach including a possibility for water skiing and ski jumping. Once Meerstad has been completed, water recreation will further increase.

Pinetown
Pinetown is a town just inland from Durban in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Pinetown is situated 16 km west of Durban at an elevation of 1,000 to 1,300 feet (305 to 395 m).

Pinetown is situated 16 km west of Durban at an elevation of 1,000 to 1,300 feet (305 to 395 m). Contents 1 History 2 Municipality boundaries 3 Infrastructure 3.1 Cricket club 3.2 Education 3.3 Pre-Schools 3.4 Local businesses 3.5 Medical facilities 4 Shack dweller's movement 5 References 6 External links History[edit] Pinetown was named after the governor of Natal, Sir Benjamin Pine. The town was established in 1850 around the Wayside Hotel, itself built in 1849 along the main wagon route between Durban and Pietermaritzburg. During the Second Boer War, the British built a concentration camp in Pinetown to house Boer women and children. A number of German settlers made Pinetown their base and this accounts for the neighbourhood known as New Germany and the German Lutheran Church. Indeed, to this day imported German cakes and goodies pack the shelves at Christmas time in the Knowles Spar, the largest grocery store of Pinetown. The area of Clermont was a solely black residential zone during the apartheid era, with land tenure being on a freehold basis unlike the state-owned townships elsewhere in the Durban vicinity. This meant residents enjoyed an atmosphere of freedom and this led to Clermont being a base for some well-known political activists during the apartheid era such as the lawyer Archie Gumede. Other personalities associated with Clermont are relatives of the leader of the world-renowned "Ladysmith Black Mambazo" musical group. Municipality boundaries[edit] No longer a separate municipality, Pinetown is now part of the larger eThekwini Municipality and, for voting purposes, falls within the IEC electoral Ward 18. The area from Cowies Hill in the east, along Josiah Gumede (Old Main) Road/M1 to Westmead industrial area in the west, is commonly referred to as the Pinetown area[according to whom?]; however, Pinetown extends strictly from Caversham Glen to Manors. The foundations and structures of the original town can be found at the corner of Josiah Gumede (Old Main) Road and Stapleton Road. Infrastructure[edit] Cricket club[edit] Pinetown Cricket Club, established in 1873, is believed to be the oldest cricket club in KwaZulu-Natal and amongst the oldest in South Africa. The club, originally located at the Civic Centre in central Pinetown, has subsequently moved to Lahee Park. Under the chairmanship of former Pinetown mayor Vernon Hall, Lahee Park hosted ten first class games between 1974 and 1979. Former internationals Norman Crookes (twice selected for the Springbok squad) and Tertius Bosch have previously represented the club. Khaya Zondo and Cameron Delport from the 2010 Dolphins team have a close association with the club, as do KZN "B" cricketers Bruce Kruger and Kyle Buckthorp. Comrades Marathon Pinetown is situated on the world-famous Comrades Marathon route which runs along the Old Main Road from Westville, over Cowies Hill past the Civic Centre and on to Fields Hill, and vice versa. This event always attracts hundreds of spectators who line the route every year to catch a glimse of their friends and loved ones in the marathon. Education[edit] One of five campuses of the University of KwaZulu-Natal is in Pinetown, on the corner of Richmond and Mariannhill Roads. The Edgewood campus was originally established in the 1970s as a college to train (mostly white) students as teachers for the apartheid government's schools serving the white community. The purpose-built facilities were superior to other colleges of education where students of other races were trained as teachers. The specialised facilities enabled the training of art, music, drama, science and physical education teachers, and included rooms with overhead viewing platforms for unobtrusive classroom lesson demonstrations. In 2001, as part of the central government's rationalisation of the higher education landscape, the Edgewood College of Education was incorporated into the University of Natal. Then in 2004, with the merger of the Universities of Natal and Durban-Westville to form the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Edgewood became the new University's 5th campus. Edgewood campus is wholly dedicated to the education of teachers and education professionals and is one of the largest producers of new teachers in South Africa. On this campus the University's School of Education offers a four-year full-time Bachelor of Education (B Ed) degree and one-year full-time Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) for those wanting a teaching qualification. Various other certificates are also offered as in-service training for teachers, as well as Honours, Masters and Doctoral degrees. The library collection is specially equipped to enable those studying education from undergraduate through to doctoral levels. Schools in Pinetown include: Pinetown Boys' High School Pinetown Girls' High School Benjamin Pine Primary School Sarnia Primary School Highway College (independent) John Wesley School (independent) Pinetown Junior & Senior Primary School Browns School (special needs education) St Benedict School Pinetown (independent) Lyndhurst Primary School New Germany Primary School Ashley Primary School St Francis College (independent) The only Afrikaans-medium school in the area is "Gelofte Skool", whose name translates as "school of the vow" in Afrikaans. It is a combined school i.e. with classes from Grade R (reception year) to Grade 12. Pre-Schools[edit] Pre-Schools in Pinetown include: Kokkewiet Pre Pimêre Skool - Afrikaans Stepping Stones Pre-Primary School - English Whizz Kidz Pre-Primary School - English Local businesses[edit] Pinetown has a reputation as a "motor town", due to the high number of motor dealerships along Old Main Road.

Balak
Balak (Hebrew: ???????? ??l?q, "devastator") was a king of Moab described in the Book of Numbers in the Hebrew Bible, where his dealings with the prophet Balaam are recounted. Balak tried to engage Balaam for the purpose of cursing the migrating Israelite community (Numbers 22:1-5). A famous but enigmatic scene when Balaam talk with a speaking donkey ensues (Numbers 22:21-35). According to Numbers 22:2, and Joshua 24:9, Balak was the son of Zippor.

(July 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Balak (Hebrew: ???????? ??l?q, "devastator") was a king of Moab described in the Book of Numbers in the Hebrew Bible, where his dealings with the prophet Balaam are recounted. Balak tried to engage Balaam for the purpose of cursing the migrating Israelite community (Numbers 22:1-5). A famous but enigmatic scene when Balaam talk with a speaking donkey ensues (Numbers 22:21-35). According to Numbers 22:2, and Joshua 24:9, Balak was the son of Zippor. In the preceding chapter of Numbers,[1] the Israelites, seeking the Promised Land following their Exodus from Egypt, had defeated the Canaanites at a place named Hormah, the Amorites and the people of Bashan, and next approached Moab. The biblical narrative stresses the fears of the people of Moab, who were 'exceedingly afraid' and 'sick with dread' (NKJV) or 'terrified (GNT) (Numbers 22:3). Their fears appear to relate to the size of the Israelite population and the consequent resource depletion which could be expected if they were permitted to occupy Moabite land. Balak initially conferred with his Midianite allies [2] in order to block Israelite settlement, before sending his elders to seek Balaam's curse on them. The Midianites appear to have been co-located with the Moabites - according to the Targum of Jonathan, they were one alliance of people at this time [3] and therefore had a common interest in preventing Israelite settlement of the area. After his mission with Balaam to curse Israelites was vain, Balak decided to ally with Midianite to gather their maid in order to lead Israelites men astray in adultery. Other sources detailing the story of Balak: Numbers 22–24 Judges 11:25 - This is the only time in the Bible that Balak is not mentioned in direct conjunction with Balaam. Micah 6:5 According to the Pulpit Commentary, Balak seems to be mentioned by name on a papyrus in the British Museum.[4] Contents 1 The Zohar 2 New Testament 3 Weekly Torah Portion 4 Etymology 5 References The Zohar[edit] The Zohar, basic text of the Kabalah , offers a special interpretation to the Balak being "The Son of Zippor". In Hebrew, "Zippor" (?????) means "bird". According to the Zohar, this was not the name of Balak's father but rather referred to a magical metal bird which Balak made use of. As the Zohar recounts, such a bird has a head made of gold, a mouth made of silver and wings made of copper mixed with silver, and its body is made of gold; once the bird is made, it should be put during the day in a window facing the Sun and during the night in a window facing the Moon, while burning incense in front of it for seven days and seven nights. Thereupon, the bird would start talking and foretelling of what is about to happen. Only the most skilled of wizards could construct such a bird. Balak, the greatest wizard of his age, managed it. The bird was always sitting on Balak's shoulder and whispering in his ear, and therefore he was nicknamed "Son of the Bird". The Zohar further recounts that the bird spoke true words of prophecy in Balak's ear and warned him not to set himself against the Sons of Israel, and also foretold of the harsh punishment in store for himself and for the Moabits. Nevertheless, Balak persisted in his wrong way and was punished exactly as the bird foretold.[5] New Testament[edit] Revelation 2:12 - 2:14 also refers to Balak: 12 `And to the messenger of the assembly in Pergamos write: These things saith he who is having the sharp two-edged sword: 13 I have known thy works, and where thou dost dwell—where the throne of the Adversary [is] -- and thou dost hold fast my name, and thou didst not deny my faith, even in the days in which Antipas [was] my faithful witness, who was put to death beside you, where the Adversary doth dwell. 14 `But I have against thee a few things: That thou hast there those holding the teaching of Balaam, who did teach Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol-sacrifices, and to commit whoredom. (Young's Literal Translation)[1] Weekly Torah Portion[edit] Balak is also the name of the weekly parshah or portion in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading, constituting Numbers 22:2–25:9 which tells the story of Balak. Etymology[edit] There are various proposed etymologies for the name Balak, all having to do with children or "waste" - The name Balak is in modern times claimed to come from the sparsely used Hebrew verb (balaq), waste or lay waste (Isaiah 24:1,3; Jeremiah 51:2). There are no derivations of this verb besides this name. Other proposals are: Devastator (BDB Theological Dictionary), Empty (NOBS Study Bible Name List), or Wasting (Jones' Dictionary of Old Testament Proper Names).

Darryl Alexander Duffy (born 16 April 1984 in Glasgow) is a Scottish footballer who currently plays as a striker for Indian club Mohun Bagan AC. Contents 1 Club career 1.1 Scotland 1.2 England 1.3 India 2 International career 3 Statistics 3.1 Club 4 Honours 5 References 6 External links Club career[edit] Scotland[edit] Duffy made his debut for Rangers in a Scottish League Cup match against Forfar on 28 October 2003.[1] coming on as an 84th-minute substitute for Maurice Ross.[2] Two months later, the 19 year old Duffy would make his league debut, in a 2–1 win over Dundee.[3] After rejecting an offer from Queen of the South, Duffy signed for Falkirk in the following June. The then Falkirk manager John Hughes said that some "other clubs" from Scotland as well as from abroad were also interested in his signature.[4] He scored on his debut against Ayr in the Scottish League Challenge Cup.[5] He scored on his debut in a Scottish League Challenge Cup against Ayr.[5][6] In the following month, he would start his scoring with a brace against Montrose, finding the net in the 15th and 31rst minute of a 4–1 victory.[7] This would mark a start of nine goals in seven matches, and come the end of the season, Duffy would score a total of 27 goals in 44 appearances.[8] His goal against St Johnstone would help Falkirk move to third place in the league table[9] and Falkirk would end the season as the champions of the Scottish First Division, thus winning promotion to Scottish Premier League.[10] He also went on to bag the Young Player of the Year award, along with the Young Player of August award.[11] In the start of the new season, he was linked for a move away from the club, even though manager Highes was optimistic of keeping him. In an interview to the club's website, he said "I've spoken to Darryl and he is fully committed to Falkirk FC."[12] Duffy's first goal in the Premier League would come against Livingston. In the 2–0 victory, his 72nd minute shot would find the net, due to a deflection off Greg Strong.[13] He would play a total of 16 matches, scoring nine goals in the top tier of the Scottish League until his transfer to Hull City.[14] England[edit] Duffy joined Hull City on 10 January 2006, penning a two and a half year contract. Falkirk chairman Campbell Christie expressed his disappointment about the transfer saying that Duffy wanted to "develop" his career in England.[15] Though BBC wrote that the transfer fee was £250,000, The Guardian said that he joined the club for an undisclosed fee.[16] However, with limited opportunities at Hull, particularly after the departure of manager Peter Taylor, he joined Hartlepool United on loan in November 2006, scoring 5 goals in 10 games for the then League Two side. An even more productive loan spell followed in February 2007, when Duffy joined League One side Swansea City on loan, scoring five goals in as many starts, as the Swans narrowly missed out on the playoffs. In July 2007 Duffy joined Swansea permanently, signing a three-year contract for an initial fee of £200,000.[17] Bristol Rovers signed Duffy from Swansea on 3 July 2008 for a transfer fee in the region of £100,000.[18] Duffy scored twice in a 6–1 over Hereford United and in a 2–2 draw at Elland Road against Leeds United. At the end of the 2008–09 season, Duffy had scored 13 goals for Rovers. After this, however, Duffy's first team opportunities were restricted.[19] He had a loan spell at Carlisle United[20] where he scored once against MK Dons.[21] On 30 August 2010, Duffy signed a season-long loan deal with SPL side Hibernian to team up with his former Falkirk manager John Hughes.[22] Duffy was ostensibly signed by Hibs as a replacement for Anthony Stokes,[19] but suffered a foot injury soon after signing for the club.[23] The injury meant that Duffy was unable to play for Hibs before Hughes left the club by mutual consent.[24] Duffy featured infrequently after he returned from injury and Hibs announced in April 2011 that he would return to Bristol after the loan deal was completed.[25] Duffy was one of seventeen players released by Rovers in May 2011.[26] Cheltenham Town announced in July that they had agreed to sign Duffy.[27] The striker hit his first goals for the club in a 3–2 win at Northampton Town. He finished the 2011–12 season as top goalscorer with 15 goals.[28] Cheltenham reached the League Two play-off final, but lost to Crewe.[28] Duffy then fell out of favour at Cheltenham, making just five starting appearances in the 2012–13 season.[28] He was offered a new contract by Cheltenham in May 2013,[29] but he decided to leave the club due to his frustration at not playing regularly.[28] India[edit] After training with Kilmarnock during the 2013 close season, Duffy signed for Indian club Salgaocar.[28] Duffy scored the winner on his debut for Salgaocar in their 1–0 win over Churchill Brothers.[30] Scottish striker scored 14 goals in 24 games for Salgaocar and won the prestigious Golden Boot in I-League along with Sunil Chhetri.[31] On 2 September 2015, he signed for Indian Super League franchise FC Goa on loan till the end of the season.[32] Duffy left Goa in October due to hair line fracture on his shin bone.[33] International career[edit] Duffy was selected for Scotland B against Poland and Turkey during the 2005 Future Cup.[34] Statistics[edit] Club[edit] As of 30 May 2015[35] Club Season League Cup[36] Continental[37] Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Rangers 2003-04[1] Scottish Premier League 1 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 Total 1 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 Falkirk 2004-05[8] Scottish First Division 41 18 3 0 0 0 44 18 2005-06[38] Scottish Premier League 16 9 0 0 0 0 16 9 Total 57 27 3 0 0 0 60 27 Hull City 2005-06[38] Championship 15 3 0 0 0 0 15 3 2006-07[39] Championship 9 0 2 0 0 0 11 0 Total 24 3 2 0 0 0 26 3 Hartlepool United (loan) 2006-07[39] League Two 10 5 0 0 0 0 10 5 Total 10 5 0 0 0 0 10 5 Swansea City (loan) 2006-07 League One 8 5 0 0 0 0 8 5 Swansea City 2007-08[40] League One 20 1 4 0 0 0 24 1 Total 28 6 4 0 0 0 32 6 Bristol Rovers 2008-09[41] League One 43 13 2 0 0 0 45 13 2009-10[42] League One 30 3 3 3 0 0 32 7 2010-11[43] League One 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 Total 76 16 5 3 0 0 81 19 Carlisle United (loan) 2009-10[42] League One 8 1 0 0 0 0 8 1 Total 8 1 0 0 0 0 8 1 Hibernian (loan) 2010-11[43] Scottish Premier League 7 0 2 0 0 0 9 0 Total 7 0 2 0 0 0 9 0 Cheltenham Town 2011-12[44] League Two 41 11 4 2 0 0 45 13 2012-13[45] League Two 24 2 4 0 0 0 28 2 Total 65 13 8 2 0 0 73 15 Salgaocar 2013-14 I-League 24 14 8 5 – – 32 19 2015 I-League 14 7 4 1 – – 18 8 Total 38 21 12 5 0 0 50 27 Goa (loan) 2015 Indian Super League 4 0 - - - - 4 0 Total 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 Career total 318 92 37 10 1 0 356 102 Honours[edit] Runners up League Two (1): 2011-12 References[edit] ^ a b "Darryl Duffy stats 2003-04".

Reference News (simplified Chinese: ??????; traditional Chinese: ??????; pinyin: C?nk?o Xi?ox?) is a newspaper daily which has the largest circulation in mainland China with 3 million.[1] History and profile[edit] Reference News was first published on 7 November 1931.[2] It is published by Xinhua News Agency. As the Chinese government's official news agency, Xinhua carefully selects articles from world's major news agencies and news journals and translates them into Chinese. Before the 1980s, it was the only official channel for the Chinese public to have a glimpse of the outside world.[3] The paper is also published in the Uighur, Kazakh, Korean, and Mongolian languages for ethnic minority groups in China. Reference News was at first available only to cadres and their families, but it was made available to the entire Chinese public after competition from news sources had started, and subsequently its circulation dropped from 11 million in 1980 to 4 million in 1985.[4] References[edit] ^ ????? ?Xinhua News Agency?.

It is based in Mascot, New South Wales (a suburb of Sydney) and is a public listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange. Contents 1 Corporate Structure and History 2 References 3 Footnotes 4 External links Corporate Structure and History[edit] Regional Express Holdings had its arose from the 2001 collapse of Ansett Airlines, which was the parent company of Kendell Airlines and Hazelton Airlines. A group of Singaporean investors and a collection of Australian private investors purchased the Hazelton and Kendell businesses, which were profitable entities before they were taken over by Ansett. The investors formed Australiawide Airlines, which was officially incorporated on 12 February 2002. The assets of the two airlines were purchased by Australiawide and merged to form the airline Regional Express, known as Rex. In 2005 Australiawide offered a percentage of the owners' shares (35 million out of 115 million shares, or 30.43%) to the public in a float.[2][3] At the same time an agreement was reached with the owners of Pel-Air that Australiawide would purchase Pel-Air.[4] As part of the public float process, Australiawide Airlines' name was changed to Regional Express Holdings. Regional Express Holdings is the owner of a number of other companies.[5] The main asset is Regional Express Pty. Ltd., which owns another airline - Dubbo-based Air Link. Another company is Rex Freight and Charter Pty. Ltd., which is the company that owns Pel-Air. The third subsidiary company is Rex Investment Holdings Pty. Ltd., which as of September 2007 is dormant.

Contents 1 Reception 2 Track listing 2.1 Original album 2.2 CD re-issue, limited edition with bonus tracks 3 Charts 3.1 Singles 4 External links 5 References Reception[edit] Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating Allmusic [2] The album yielded the title track single "Last Time I Saw Him", a multi-format hit that reached #1 (for three weeks) on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary, #14 on the Hot 100, and #15 on the Hot Soul singles. It peaked at #9 Pop on the Top 100 lists for both Cashbox and Record World, as well as #10 in Radio & Records. It also reached #35 in the United Kingdom. "Sleepin'" was the second U.S. single, but despite a vocal performance that had shades of Billie Holiday, only reached #70 Pop and #50 R&B. In the U.K., the chosen 2nd single was the ballad "Love Me" (#38), whose lyrics were replete with double entendres. "Behind Closed Doors" was also released and became a Top 20 hit in South Africa, reaching number 14 as well as climbing as high as #2 on the singles chart in Zimbabwe. "Last Time I Saw Him" was a bit of a musical departure for Ross, with a sound combining country with Dixieland jazz. Shortly after its release, the song was remade by country music star Dottie West, who scored success with the single on the C&W charts, reaching #8. The album had a disappointing chart run, reaching #52, and would be the last studio album Ross issued in the next three years until the Diana Ross album, released in 1976. An expanded 2-CD set was issued by Hip-O Select in 2007, including previously unreleased tracks.

It was founded by the Drum family in the late 18th century originally and was originally known as Drum's. Its zip code is 18222. Contents 1 History 1.1 18th century 1.2 19th century 1.3 20th century 2 City services 3 Schools 4 Churches 5 Notable residents 6 References 7 External links History[edit] 18th century[edit] The village was originally named "Drum's" after the Drum family, whose members developed the village's first school, post office, hotels, churches, roads, and businesses. Family members held positions as pioneers, land developers, justices of the peace, postmasters, school presidents, educators, tailors, shoe makers, Luzerne County sheriff, hotel proprietors, lawyers, and Pennsylvania state legislators.[1] The founders of Drums were the Drum family. In 1738, Philip Drum, aged 36, immigrated to America from Germany with his eight-year-old son Jacob. In 1749, Jacob married Catharine Strauss, who gave birth to a son, George, on June 12, 1762 in Northampton County, Williams Township, adjacent to Bethlehem and Easton, Pa. This was a revolutionary time in this area because America's founders such as George Washington, Martha Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton visited Bethlehem numerous times where they lodged at the Moravian Sun Inn before and during the American Revolution. According to the 1790 United States Federal Census, George Drum lived in "Allen Township" (now West Bethlehem) during the 1790s before moving his family to the Nescopeck Valley (now Sugarloaf Valley) to initiate a hotel business eventually establishing Drums town and establishing the Drums post office operation with his son's help serving Luzerne County. A 1758 map of "Bethlehem" clearly shows that "Allen Township" was the area of what is now West Bethlehem. George Drum and his family lived in West Bethlehem before establishing Drums town.[2] According to the Drum family legend, tragedy struck the family in 1774 when their farmhouse was attacked by Indians. The Indians killed Jacob and took Catharine. George (age 12) managed to escape harm by hiding in the fireplace. George survived and went on to develop the town of Drums when he reached maturity.[3] George was attracted to the beautiful Sugarloaf Valley area in Luzerne County as were other pioneers, such as John Balliet, who is also part of the Drum family tree. George became one of the pioneering settlers there in the late 18th century initiating the development of Drums village and Conyngham. George Drum was the first settler within the village of Conyngham,[4] which is where his estate still stands in impeccable condition after 2 centuries of Drum family ownership .... honorable justice of the peace; Susan (Drum) Walter (GG daughter of George Sr.) being the last known Drum family owner of the (George) Drum family estate up until the mid 1970s.[5] Susan lived till the age of 97, becoming the town's oldest resident at that time. In the late 1700s, George Drum bought land in the Nescopeck Valley (renamed Sugarloaf Valley in 1809) in areas that would become Drums and Conyngham. "Among the early settlers were George Drum, Philip Woodring, Andrew Mowery, and Henry Davis".[6] George Drum was an entrepreneur and government documents indicate he was a carpenter, contractor, builder, farmer, and justice of the peace for Sugarloaf Township. George built the first hotel-tavern in Drums.[7][8] The original Drums Hotel building still stands in Drums, but is now a privately owned residence in superb condition. The original Drums Post Office building still remains also, but is now a business center still located directly across the road from the Drums Hotel. During the 1960s the post office operation was moved next to the hotel into a newer brick building. The Drums Post Office operated there up until the early 21st century when it closed after nearly two centuries of service due to the 2008 national economic collapse. In addition, and according to church records, George was also a founding member of St. Johns Church and cemetery founded in 1799. George, his wife, and many other family members are all buried at St. Johns Cemetery. Other family members are buried at Drums Community Cemetery and Conyngham Union Cemetery. During the American Revolution (1775–83), George joined the Revolutionary War as a private in May of 1782 (at age 19) starting with the 6th Company, 4th Battalion in Captain Peter Hay's company under Colonel Philip Boehm in Williams Township, Northampton County. George was eventually promoted and commissioned as Captain of Militia for Frontier Service, 5th Company, Eighth Regiment.[8] George married Anna Margaret Woodring (born 1765), a daughter of Philip Woodring (a French Huguenot 1741–1819) and Mary Elisabetha Wagner (1743–1829) from Alsace, France. Anna & her family were from the Williams Township, Northampton County area adjacent to Easton and Bethlehem. Anna Margaret descended from an enterprising French/German family line. Her ancestors included mayors of towns in Alsace that alternatively belonged to France and Germany. Anna Margaret spoke German, Alsatian, French, and English; George spoke German and English. Her surname evolved from the French "Vatrin" (pronounced "Vatree" in French) to the German "Wotring" (pronounced "Votring" in German) to "Woodring" in America. 19th century[edit] In 1808, Philip Drum (son of George Sr.) bought land in Luzerne County from Benjamin Rush,[9] who was a close advisor to George Washington during the American Revolutionary War[10] and signed the United States Declaration of Independence.[3] In 1810, Philip established Drums' first carding mill on the Little Nescopeck River. In addition, Philip established the first wool-processing mill in 1835; it was located a short distance from the carding mill.[11] In 1814, George's second son, George Jr. (born Oct. 16, 1792), bought land next to his brother Philip.[12] Philip bought additional land in 1814, 1826, 1836, and 1847. George Sr., George Jr., Philip, & other Drum family members owned vast acreage of land in Drums, Conyngham, and surrounding counties. George Drum's two century old estate still stands in immaculate condition in Conyngham and is a fine example of colonial architecture. George Sr. and George Jr. both died in 1831. On February 27, 1858, Philip died in Drums, Butler Township, aged 71, he was buried at St. Johns Cemetery.[3] His wool mill passed to his son Jacob. Further community and land development by family members made Drums and St. Johns the commercial centers of the township. Drums is the principal village in Butler Township. It is in the heart of a rich agricultural section and is on the Old State Road leading to Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Wilkes-Barre, about six miles from the former, its natural trading point, between Big and Little Nescopeck.[13] George Drum Sr. was elected justice of the peace for Sugarloaf Township, Luzerne County, in 1811; George Drum Jr. later held the same office, George Sr.'s grandson, George W. Drum, born March 12, 1832, was elected justice of the peace in 1860 for Luzerne County based in the town of Conyngham adjacent to Drums. George W. Drum was elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly (Pennsylvania legislature) and served from 1879 to 1882.[3] George W. Drum III was also a member and trustee of the German Lutheran Church and trustee of the Conyngham Church and school land lot.[14] Jacob Drum, a son of Philip Drum and namesake of his great-grandfather, Jacob, served as justice of the peace in 1847 and 1852. Jacob's mother was Philip's first wife, Magdalene Beisal, for whom Beisals Road in Drums is named. Jacob and his wife Susan are buried at St. John's Cemetery and have an obelisk for a gravestone.[15] William Drum, son of George Sr., established the first post office in Drums in 1826 as postmaster. George Jr. was the postmaster for a time as well during the late 1820s. William Drum also helped organize the Conyngham Post Office as postmaster there in 1828.[16] According to the "Appointments of U.S. Postmasters" register, George Drum (son of Abraham) was appointed on April 28, 1854 as postmaster for the Drums post office during the 1850s. During the 1880s, Abraham Alex Drum (son of Josiah Drum & Maria Balliet) became postmaster.[17] Carrie Drum (grand daughter of Philip the 2nd) was postmistress from the 1890s into the early 1900s.[18] All told, the Drum family personally operated the Drums post office for at least a century. The Drums post office continued to operate until 2008 at which point it closed because of the nation's economy. It was in operation for nearly 2 centuries. George Sr.'s son, Abraham (b. 1797), took over ownership of the "Stage Coach Stop" Drums Hotel in the center of the town when he reached maturity. Abraham's son, George Drum (b. Dec. 2, 1827), then became proprietor of the Drums Hotel by the mid 19th century and married Emma Fritzinger.[19] The hotel was passed on to succeeding generations in the family. Abraham built an additional hotel in the mountains of Drums, just north of the town's center. The Drums Hotel (which operated for over a century) and other family businesses, sat within a triangle of roads that was the commercial heart of Drums. During the 1850s and until his death in 1862, Abraham Drum was sheriff of Luzerne County.[3] 20th century[edit] Philip L. Drum III (b. 1871) was the grandson of Philip Drum and son of Nathan from Drums. He was an alumnus of Lafayette College and a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania. Philip became a popular lawyer and a Pennsylvania state legislator in 1901 and 1902.[20] The advent of the car required modification of the township's roads. During the 1920s most of the town's roads were paved. In 1929 construction began on the present Route 309 to permit horseless carriages a more gradual incline up Butler Mountain. The automobile offered new business opportunities.[21] Drums and Saint Johns served as the commercial centers of the township for most of its history, but with the advent of automobiles and housing developments, the hub of commercial activity shifted to Route 309 by 1936.[22] As early as 1923, the Rose Progressive Development Company plotted Drums Manor as a suburban development, but the company was unable to translate its plans into reality. In 1929, however, Mr. Creast from Media, Pennsylvania, successfully developed Stone Croft Manor.[23] Charles Lindbergh landed twice at Reifenberg Airport, the airport that served Drums and St. Johns, flying The Spirit of St. Louis in 1928 and a Ford Tri-motor in 1931.[24] In 1938 a group of men organized the Drums Lions Club.[25] In 1958 Susan (Drum) Walters, great grand daughter of George Sr., was elected justice of the peace for the Sugarloaf Valley, serving the community until her death in 1973.[26] She was the oldest resident at age 97. From 1811 to 1973 (162 years) the Drum family held office as justices. In 1962 the Conyngham National Bank opened a branch in Drums. Later the Conyngham Bank merged with the First Eastern Bank of Wilkes-Barre. Under the capable direction of Frederick Peters, the Drums office of First Eastern expanded with the township with deposits of several millions.[27] On January 3, 1990, Edward W. Drum was elected Sugarloaf County Chairman for the community's government. Edward died on March 17, 2005 at age 79 bringing an end to nearly two centuries of Drum family governmental leadership. City services[edit] Drums is served by the Butler Township Police Department, which employs Chief David Pavelko, a sergeant, and five other officers.[28] Fire, rescue and emergency medical services are provided by volunteers from Valley Regional Fire and Rescue, which was formed when Butler Township Fire Company and Conyngham Fire Company merged in 2005.[29] The city's zoning and code enforcement department issues building permits.[30] Schools[edit] Drums' first school was founded by Drum family members and named the Drums school. It was constructed with logs in 1809, "on the grounds of the old Union Church", and served all the township's children. "In 1870, the Drums school was moved to a new location across the road from the present Drums school".[31] "In 1941, the original wooden Drums school was closed and a larger brick structure was built". The school is now known as the Drums Elementary/Middle School and is at 85 S. Old Turnpike Road.[31] Drums Elementary/Middle School is served today by the Hazleton Area School District.[32] In addition to the Drums Elementary Middle School, the Hazleton Area Academy of Sciences (HAAS) will be located within Drums for the 2013–2014 school year. HAAS is a magnet program that focuses on science, technology, engineering and mathematics.[33] Churches[edit] The Trinity Church project, which George W. Drum donated his land to, organized a Sunday School on May 6, 1844. The president, Isaac Drum, was born in 1820, the son of Jacob Drum. Isaac served in the American Civil War.[34] And other officers included superintendent James Smith; secretary James Hillman; treasurer William Harker; and managers Adam Beisal, Mrs. Beisal, Daniel Durst, Mrs. Yost and Mrs. Hunt. A constitution was adopted August 25, 1844. Around 1880, a new group of officers took control: president Nathan S. Drum (Son of Philip); vice president John S. Spencer; superintendent Cyrus Straw; secretary Abraham Alexander Drum (son of Josiah Drum and Maria Balliet); librarian Mary Jacobs; treasurer Josiah Drum; and managers Cyrus Straw, Henry Gilmore, John Spencer, Mrs. Hedian, Mrs L. Straw and Miss E. Jacobs.[35] St. John's Church was organized on December 26, 1799. George Drum (the first) was a founding member of the church. By April 18, 1809, Rev. Frederick Van de Sloat wrote a constitution and by-laws for the government of the congregation. The subscribers to this document were George Drum, John Balliet Sr, Philip Woodring, Jacob Speth, George Wenner, S. Earles, Jacob Balliet, Peter Hill, John Balliet Jr, Peter Scheide, Michael Beishline, Jacob Drumheller, A. Maurer, P. Ruth, J. Fuse, J. Wenner, H. Maurer, George Beishline, and Michael Bitterle.[7] One of the founders, Jacob Drumheller (in the Drum family tree), built the first building in what became Hazleton, Pennsylvania in 1809. Many founding members of the Drum family have their final resting place at St. John's Cemetery, including the original George Drum and wife Anna Margaret Woodring; Philip Drum and second wife Magadalena, Jacob Drum and wife Susan Mochamaer, Abraham Drum and wife Magdalene, John Drum and wife Anna Marie, and Isaac Drum. Present day descendants are also buried at St. Johns such as Edward T. Drum (Corporal — Sergeant j in WW II, d. 1995 & father of Gary E. Drum, Richard, & Nancy). Edward is the 3rd great grandson of George Drum Sr.. St. Johns has become the family's primary cemetery for the past 215 years.[citation needed] Balliet, Beisal, Beishline, Butz, Chapin, Curwood, Drasher, Dreisbach, Drumheller, Eroh, Fink, Fisher, Fritzinger, Gilmore, Greece, Hart, Heller, Helman, Hess, Hughes, Klinger, Lauderbach, Miller, Mochamer, Morgan, Santee, Schleppy, Shearer, Strauss, Straw, Turnbach, Roth, Wagner, Whitenight, Whitebread, Wilkins, Winter, Wolfe, Woodring, Wotring, Yoch, Young, and Zimmerman are some names in the extended Drum family who lived in the Drums area and contributed to the community.[36] Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church was founded with the building committee team consisting of Rev. Colborn, Stephen Drum (son of Abraham), Cyrus & Andrew Straw, an A. P. Goedecke.[7] As of 2013, places of worship includes the Drums United Methodist Church, Good Shepherd Church, Christ Reformed Episcopal Church, St. Paul's United Methodist Church and Seventh Day Adventist Church.[37] Notable residents[edit] Nate Eachus, NFL football player.[38] References[edit] ^ Helman, Laura.

A Poem Is a Naked Person
A Poem Is A Naked Person is a film directed by Les Blank, filmed in 1972-1974 but not publicly released until 2015, after Blank's death. The film is a documentary about musician Leon Russell, produced and financed largely by Russell and his then-business partner Denny Cordell. Blank spent a large portion of two years on the film, but then its release was delayed for forty years due to creative differences and music clearance problems. Blank's son, Harrod Blank (who was a child when the movie was filmed), spent years working on the clearances, before it was finally shown publicly in 2015.[1]

Blank shot many hours of footage for the film, including the expected concerts, rehearsals, and interviews, but also atmospheric material intended to capture the mood and surroundings, later described by Harrod Blank as "what he [Les] was attracted to: lake footage, sunsets, beautiful women, eccentric characters, Oklahoma folk." A portion of the film depicted underground artist Jim Franklin painting a mural in Russell's empty swimming pool. The result was an untraditional film whose fate became even more uncertain after Russell and Cordell terminated their business relationship in 1976.[1][2] For many years, A Poem Is A Naked Person was shown only at special screenings with Les Blank in attendance.[3][4] In 2011 Russell told Billboard that he didn't like the film, and didn't intend to release it.[5] Also in 2011, when the International Documentary Association honored Blank with a career achievement award, the film was described as "perhaps the greatest film about rock 'n' roll and American music that you will likely never see".[6] The film finally received its public premiere (with Russell in the audience) in March 2015 at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, prior to theatrical and DVD release.[3] The movie was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection on March 29, 2016. Reception[edit] In 1979 Robert Christgau wrote a lengthy article about Les Blank that for the most part praised Blank's work in his food-oriented documentaries, but included sharp criticisms of this film. Christgau derided it as an "arty horror movie of a documentary" that "abandons subtlety for an overstated visual gadgetry that screams repulsion out of control."[7] When the film was finally released, however, critical reception was positive. Writing for Film Comment, Daniel Eagan noted the "extraordinary concert footage" of "intimate, sweaty, incantatory music shaped for the moment at hand" as well as studio footage with "a different sense of intimacy, of polished professionals displaying casual, almost effortless expertise."[1] Carson Lund of Slant Magazine praised it as "a free-floating portrait of the eccentric neo-Gospel Oklahoman frying pan that is Russell's mini-universe".[8] Alex Pappademas of Grantland said it was "one of the greatest rock documentaries I’ve ever seen, as eloquent an evocation of the reality-distortion field around rock stars as D.A. Pennebaker’s Dont Look Back or Robert Frank’s Cocksucker Blues, but funnier and stranger than either."[9] See also[edit] List of American films of 1974 References[edit] ^ a b c Daniel Eagan, "Back Home: Les Blank's A Poem Is A Naked Person", Film Comment, March 16, 2015. ^ Jerry Wofford, "Leon Russell documentary 'A Poem is a Naked Person' makes debut at South by Southwest festival", Tulsa World, March 23, 2015. ^ a b Lars Nilsen, "Counterculture Time Capsule: Forty years later, Les Blank's Leon Russell rock doc sees the light of day", Austin Chronicle, March 13, 2015. ^ Jonathan Marlow, "The Art of Filmmaking: Les Blank", Fandor, December 2, 2014. ^ Phil Gallo, "Leon Russell Hits the Road After 'Union' Success", Billboard, April 11, 2011. ^ Taylor Segrest, "2011 Career Achievement Award--Visionary Wayfarer: Les Blank", Documentary Magazine, Winter 2012. ^ Robert Christgau, "Music, Food & the Idea of the 'Folk': Contra Les Blank", The Village Voice, November 19, 1979. ^ Carson Lund, "SXSW 2015: The Boy, 6 Years, & A Poem Is a Naked Person", Slant Magazine, March 17, 2015. ^ Alex Pappademas, "SXSW Film Fest Superlatives: Rock Docs, Yuppie Nightmares, and a Ghost in Your iPhone", Grantland, March 23, 2015.

Singapore Lions of Singapore will also participate in the 2012 season, replacing Harimau Muda A. Perlis FA and Pahang FA were relegated at the end of the 2011 Super League Malaysia after finishing the season in the bottom two places of the league table. 2011 Malaysia Premier League champions PKNS FC and runners-up Sarawak FA secured direct promotion to the Super League. Following an agreement between the Football Association of Singapore and the Football Association of Malaysia, Young Lions, with most of the members of the squad are players from Singapore's national under-23 team, will replace Harimau Muda A, which represent the Malaysian Under-23 national football team. While the Singapore Lions will compete at the Malaysia Super League, Harimau Muda A will take the Young Lions position in the S. League.[1][2] Young Lions was later replaced by a new team, named Lions XII that will replace the former under-23 football team.[3] Felda United FC Johor FC Kedah FA Kelantan FA (2011 Super League Malaysia champions) Kuala Lumpur FA Negeri Sembilan FA Perak FA PKNS FC¹ Sabah FA Sarawak FA¹ Selangor FA Lions XII* T-Team Terengganu FA * – Lions XII (Originally to participate was Young Lions of Singapore and will replace Harimau Muda A as Harimau Muda A will replace Young Lions in the S.

The KLFA Stadium was closed down for repairs, meaning both Felda United FC and Kuala Lumpur FA were forced to move their home stadiums to the Hang Jebat Stadium which is located in Malacca. The stadium will also be the only venue that will be played at daylight, rather than playing in the night. Terengganu FA had shared stadiums with fellow team neighbours, T-Team since 2011 after the roof collapse of the Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium. However, on 19 December 2011, The Terengganu Menteri Besar, Ahmad Said announced that the stadium will undergo repairs and maybe will be usable for Terengganu FA halfway through the league.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Day Out of Days is a chart used by filmmakers to tally the number of paid days for each cast member. The chart must be prepared after the shooting schedule. Once it has been completed, work can begin on a budget. The Day Out of Days is arranged as a grid, with columns representing days and rows representing cast members. Letters are used to indicate paid days. Typically, W is used to indicate a work day (the cast member will perform on that day), T indicates a travel day, and R a rehearsal day. All three count as paid days. The letters S (Start) and F (Finish) are used to indicate the first and last paid days. For example, a cast member's first paid day (usually a rehearsal day) appears as SR; the last paid day (usually a work day) appears as WF. Special consideration must be given to idle periods in the Day Out of Days. A cast member can either be held (paid) or dropped (not paid) during an idle period. The Screen Actors Guild has very specific rules addressing when an actor can—or especially can't—be dropped. (The rules don't apply for actors with run-of-show agreements.) In the Day Out of Days chart, hold days are indicated by an H. When a cast member is to be dropped, a D marks the last paid day before the drop, and a P indicates the day when the cast member will be picked back up.[1] References[edit] ^ "What is a Day-Out-Of-Days Schedule?".

Hybrid (biology)
In biology a hybrid, also known as cross breed, is the result of mixing, through sexual reproduction, two animals or plants of different breeds, varieties, species or genera.[1] Using genetic terminology, it may be defined as follows.[2]
For other uses, see Hybrid. Hercules, a "liger", a lion/tiger hybrid. In biology a hybrid, also known as cross breed, is the result of mixing, through sexual reproduction, two animals or plants of different breeds, varieties, species or genera.[1] Using genetic terminology, it may be defined as follows.[2] Hybrid generally refers to any offspring resulting from the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually will result in a high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not, strictly speaking, synonymous. a genetic hybrid carries two different alleles of the same gene a structural hybrid results from the fusion of gametes that have differing structure in at least one chromosome, as a result of structural abnormalities a numerical hybrid results from the fusion of gametes having different haploid numbers of chromosomes a permanent hybrid is a situation where only the heterozygous genotype occurs, because all homozygous combinations are lethal. From a taxonomic perspective, hybrid refers to: Offspring resulting from the interbreeding between two animal species or plant species.[3] See also hybrid speciation. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are sometimes known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Extremely rare interfamilial hybrids have been known to occur (such as the guineafowl hybrids).[4] No interordinal (between different orders) animal hybrids are known. The third type of hybrid consists of crosses between populations, breeds or cultivars within a single species. This meaning is often used in plant and animal breeding, where hybrids are commonly produced and selected, because they have desirable characteristics not found or inconsistently present in the parent individuals or populations.

The template for this is the naming of tiger-lion hybrids as liger and tigon in the 1920s.[7] This was playfully (but unsystematically) extended to a number of other hybrids, or hypothetical hybrids, such as beefalo (1960s), humanzee (1980s), cama (1998). Types of hybrids[edit] Depending on the parents, there are a number of different types of hybrids;[8] Single cross hybrids — result from the cross between two true breeding organisms and produces an F1 generation called an F1 hybrid (F1 is short for Filial 1, meaning "first offspring"). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other. Double cross hybrids — result from the cross between two different F1 hybrids.[9] Three-way cross hybrids — result from the cross between one parent that is an F1 hybrid and the other is from an inbred line.[10] Triple cross hybrids — result from the crossing of two different three-way cross hybrids. Population hybrids — result from the crossing of plants or animals in a population with another population. These include crosses between organisms such as interspecific hybrids or crosses between different breeds. Stable hybrid – a horticultural term which typically refers to an annual plant that, if grown and bred in a small monoculture free of external pollen (e.g., an air-filtered greenhouse) will produce offspring that are "true to type" with respect to phenotype; i.e., a true breeding organism.[11] Hybrid species – results from hybrid populations evolving reproductive barriers against their parent species through hybrid speciation.[12] Interspecific hybrids[edit] Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating two species, normally from within the same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents. The offspring of an interspecific cross are very often sterile; thus, hybrid sterility prevents the movement of genes from one species to the other, keeping both species distinct.[13] Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes the two species have, for example donkeys have 62 chromosomes, while horses have 64 chromosomes, and mules and hinnies have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.[14] Most often other processes occurring in plants and animals keep gametic isolation and species distinction. Species often have different mating or courtship patterns or behaviors, the breeding seasons may be distinct and even if mating does occur antigenic reactions to the sperm of other species prevent fertilization or embryo development. Hybridisation is much more common among organisms that spawn indiscriminately, like soft corals and among plants. While it is possible to predict the genetic composition of a backcross on average, it is not possible to accurately predict the composition of a particular backcrossed individual, due to random segregation of chromosomes. In a species with two pairs of chromosomes, a twice backcrossed individual would be predicted to contain 12.5% of one species' genome (say, species A). However, it may, in fact, still be a 50% hybrid if the chromosomes from species A were lucky in two successive segregations, and meiotic crossovers happened near the telomeres. The chance of this is fairly high: ( 1 2 ) ( 2 × 2 ) = 1 16 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)^{(2\times 2)}={\frac {1}{16}}} (where the "two times two" comes about from two rounds of meiosis with two chromosomes); however, this probability declines markedly with chromosome number and so the actual composition of a hybrid will be increasingly closer to the predicted composition. Hybrid species[edit] Main article: Hybrid speciation While not very common, a few animal species have been recognized as being the result of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is an example of a novel animal species that resulted from natural hybridization. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid species between gray wolf and coyote,[15] although its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy.[16][17][18] The European edible frog appears to be a species, but is actually a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs. The edible frog population is dependent on the presence of at least one of the parents species to be maintained.[19] Hybrid species of plants are much more common than animals. Many of the crop species are hybrids, and hybridization appears to be an important factor in speciation in some plant groups. Examples of hybrid animals and animal populations derived from hybrids[edit] Mammals[edit] A "zonkey", a zebra/donkey hybrid. A "jaglion", a jaguar/lion hybrid. Equid hybrids Mule, a cross of female horse and a male donkey. Hinny, a cross between a female donkey and a male horse. Mule and hinny are examples of reciprocal hybrids. Zebroids Zeedonk or Zonkey, a zebra/donkey cross. Zorse, a zebra/horse cross Zony or Zetland, a zebra/pony cross ("zony" is a generic term; "zetland" is specifically a hybrid of the Shetland pony breed with a zebra) hybrid ass, a cross between a donkey and an onager or Asian wild ass. Bovid hybrids Dzo, zo or yakow; a cross between a domestic cow/bull and a yak. Beefalo, a cross of an American bison and a domestic cow. This is a fertile breed; this along with genetic evidence has caused them to be recently reclassified into the same genus, Bos.[citation needed] ?ubro?, a hybrid between wisent (European bison) and domestic cow. Sheep-goat hybrid is the cross between a sheep and a goat, which belong to different genera. Ursid hybrids, such as the grizzly-polar bear hybrid, occur between black bears, brown bears, and polar bears. Felid hybrids Savannah cat are a fertile breed developed originally from a cross between the serval [Leptailurus serval] and a domestic cat [Felis catus]. A hybrid between a Bengal tiger and a Siberian tiger is an example of an intra-specific hybrid. It also includes the Indochinese tiger, Sumatran tiger too. Pumapards are the hybrid crosses between a puma and a leopard. Ligers and tigons (crosses between a lion and a tiger - the difference in name due to what species the mother and father were - ligers have a lion father and a tiger mother) and other Panthera hybrids such as the lijagulep. Various other wild cat crosses are known involving the lynx, bobcat, leopard, serval, etc. Liligers are the hybrid cross between a male lion and a ligress. Bengals are a fertile breed developed originally from a cross between the Asian leopard cat [Prionailurus bengalensis] and the domestic cat [Felis catus]. Fertile canid hybrids occur between coyotes, wolves, dingoes, jackals and domestic dogs. Hybrids between black and white rhinoceroses have been recognized. Hybrid camel, a cross between a bactrian camel and a dromedary camel[20] Cama, a cross between a camel and a llama, also an intergeneric hybrid. Wholphin, a fertile but very rare cross between a false killer whale and a bottlenose dolphin. At Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, a cross between an African elephant (male) and an Asian elephant (female). The male calf was named Motty. He died of intestinal infection after twelve days. Bornean and Sumatran orangutan hybrids have occurred in captivity. Birds[edit] See also: Bird hybrid A mule, a domestic canary/goldfinch hybrid. Hybrids between spotted owls and barred owls Cagebird breeders sometimes breed hybrids between species of finch, such as goldfinch × canary. These birds are known as mules. The perlin is a peregrine falcon – merlin hybrid. Gamebird hybrids, hybrids between gamebirds and domestic fowl, including chickens, guineafowl and peafowl, interfamilial hybrids. Numerous macaw hybrids and lovebird hybrids are also known in aviculture. Red kite × black kite: five bred unintentionally at a falconry center in England. (It is reported[weasel words] that the black kite (the male) refused female black kites but mated with two female red kites.) The mulard duck, hybrid of the domestic pekin duck and domesticated muscovy ducks. In Australia, New Zealand and other areas where the Pacific black duck occurs, it is hybridised by the much more aggressive introduced mallard. This is a concern to wildlife authorities throughout the affected area, as it is seen as Genetic pollution of the black duck gene pool. Hybridisation in gulls is a reasonably frequent occurrence in the wild. Reptiles[edit] Hybrid iguana, a single?cross hybrid resulting from natural interbreeding between male marine iguanas and female land iguanas since the late 2000s. Crestoua, a cross between a Rhacodactylus Ciliatus (crested gecko) and a Rhacodactylus Chahoua. Colubrid snakes of the tribe Lampropeltini have been shown to produce fertile hybrid offspring. Hybridization between the endemic Cuban crocodile (Crocodilus rhombifer) and the widely distributed American crocodile (Crocodilus acutus) is causing conservation problems for the former species as a threat to its genetic integrity.[21][clarification needed] Saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) have mated with Siamese crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis) in captivity producing offspring which in many cases have grown over 20 feet (6.1 metres) in length. It is likely that wild hybridization occurred historically in parts of southeast Asia. Many species of boas and pythons are known to produce hybrids, such as carball (a cross between a ball python and a carpet python) or a bloodball (a cross between a blood python and a ball python) however, most of these only occur in captivity. Contrary to popular belief, boa–python hybrids are not possible due to their differing reproductive functions. Boas only produce hybrids with other species of boas, and pythons only produce hybrids with other species of pythons. Amphibians[edit] Japanese giant salamanders and Chinese giant salamanders have created hybrids that threaten the survival of Japanese giant salamanders due to the competition for similar resources in Japan.[22] Fish[edit] Blood parrot cichlid, which is probably created by crossing a red head cichlid and a Midas cichlid or red devil cichlid A group of about 50 hybrids between Australian blacktip shark and the larger common blacktip shark was found by Australia's East Coast in 2012. This is the only known case of hybridization in sharks.[23] Silver bream and common bream commonly produce sterile hybrids. Tiger muskie is a sterile hybrid between northern pike and muskellunge. Insects[edit] Killer bees were created during an attempt to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions. This was done by crossing a European honey bee and an African bee. The Colias eurytheme and C. philodice butterflies have retained enough genetic compatibility to produce viable hybrid offspring.[24] Hybrid plants[edit] A sterile hybrid between Trillium cernuum and T. grandiflorum An ornamental lily hybrid known as Lilium 'Citronella'[25] Many hybrids are created by humans, but natural hybrids occur as well. Plant species hybridize more readily than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are more often fertile hybrids and may reproduce, though there still exist sterile hybrids and selective hybrid elimination where the offspring are less able to survive and are thus eliminated before they can reproduce. A number of plant species are the result of hybridization and polyploidy with many plant species easily cross pollinating and producing viable seeds, the distinction between each species is often maintained by geographical isolation or differences in the flowering period. Since plants hybridize frequently without much work, they are often created by humans in order to produce improved plants. These improvements can include the production of more or improved seeds, fruits or other plant parts for consumption, or to make a plant more winter or heat hardy or improve its growth and/or appearance for use in horticulture. Much work is now being done with hybrids to produce more disease resistant plants for both agricultural and horticultural crops. In many groups of plants hybridization has been used to produce larger and more showy flowers and new flower colors. Hybridization may be restricted to the desired parent species through the use of pollination bags. Many plant genera and species have their origins in polyploidy. Autopolyploidy results from the sudden multiplication in the number of chromosomes in typical normal populations caused by unsuccessful separation of the chromosomes during meiosis. Tetraploids (plants with four sets of chromosomes rather than two) are common in a number of different groups of plants and over time these plants can differentiate into distinct species from the normal diploid line. In Oenothera lamarchiana the diploid species has 14 chromosomes, this species has spontaneously given rise to plants with 28 chromosomes that have been given the name Oenothera gigas. When hybrids are formed between the tetraploids and the diploid population, the resulting offspring tend to be sterile triploids, thus effectively stopping the intermixing of genes between the two groups of plants (unless the diploids, in rare cases, produce unreduced gametes). Another form of polyploidy called allopolyploidy occurs when two different species mate and produce polyploid hybrids. Usually the typical chromosome number is doubled, and the four sets of chromosomes can pair up during meiosis, thus the polyploids can produce offspring. Usually, these offspring can mate and reproduce with each other but cannot back-cross with the parent species. Allopolyploids may be able to adapt to new habitats that neither of their parent species inhabited. Species Common name Family Hybridization Confirmed or putative hybridization?

Triploid bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds (and are parthenocarpic). Heterosis[edit] Main article: heterosis Hybrids are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon most common with plant hybrids, which when present is known as hybrid vigor (heterosis) or heterozygote advantage.[28] A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype displaying more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines.[29] Plant breeders make use of a number of techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize producing countries.[30] Examples of plant hybrids[edit] The multiplication symbol × (not italicised) indicates a hybrid in the Latin binomial nomenclature. Placed before the binomial it indicates a hybrid between species from different genera (intergeneric hybrid):- × Fatshedera lizei, a hybrid between Hedera helix and Fatsia japonica × Heucherella, a hybrid genus between Heuchera and Tiarella × Philageria veitchii is a hybrid between Lapageria rosea and Philesia magellanica; it is more similar in appearance to the former Leyland cypress, [× Cupressocyparis leylandii] hybrid between Monterey cypress and Nootka cypress Triticale, [× Triticosecale] a wheat–rye hybrid × Urceocharis, a hybrid between Eucharis and Urceolina Interspecific plant hybrids include: Dianthus × allwoodii (Dianthus caryophyllus × Dianthus plumarius) Limequat Citrus × floridana, key lime Citrus aurantiifolia and kumquat Citrus japonica hybrid Loganberry Rubus × loganobaccus, a hybrid between raspberry Rubus idaeus and blackberry Rubus ursinus London plane (Platanus orientalis × Platanus occidentalis), thus forming Platanus × acerifolia Magnolia × alba (Magnolia champaca × Magnolia montana) Peppermint, a hybrid between spearmint and water mint Quercus × warei (Quercus robur × Quercus bicolor) 'Nadler' (marketed in the United States under the trade name Kindred Spirit hybrid oak) Tangelo, a hybrid of a Mandarin orange and a pomelo which may have been developed in Asia about 3,500 years ago Wheat; most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids. Bread wheat is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses; durum (pasta) wheat is a tetraploid hybrid of two wild grasses Grapefruit, hybrid between a pomelo and the Jamaican sweet orange Some natural hybrids: Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid which spreads by rhizome division Evening primrose, a flower which was the subject of famous experiments by Hugo de Vries on polyploidy and diploidy Hybrids in nature[edit] Hybridization between two closely related species is actually a common occurrence in nature but is also being greatly influenced by anthropogenic changes as well.[31] Hybridization is a naturally occurring genetic process where individuals from two genetically distinct populations mate.[32] As stated above, it can occur both intraspecifically, between different distinct populations within the same species, and interspecifically, between two different species. Hybrids can be either sterile/not viable or viable/fertile. This affects the kind of effect that this hybrid will have on its and other populations that it interacts with.[33] Many hybrid zones are known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying the mechanisms of speciation (Hybrid speciation). Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the North West Territories confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile grizzly–polar bear hybrids.[34] Anthropogenic hybridization[edit] Changes to the environment caused by humans, such as fragmentation and Introduced species, are becoming more widespread.[35] This increases the challenges in managing certain populations that are experiencing introgression, and is a focus of conservation genetics. Introduced species and habitat fragmentation[edit] Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally such as establishing a population to be used as a biological control, and unintentionally such as accidental escapes of individuals out of agriculture. This causes drastic global effects on various populations, including through hybridization.[33][36] When habitats become broken apart, one of two things can occur, genetically speaking. The first is that populations that were once connected can be cut off from one another, preventing their genes from interacting. Occasionally, this will result in a population of one species breeding with a population of another species as a means of surviving such as the case with the red wolves. Their population numbers being so small, they needed another means of survival. Habitat fragmentation also led to the influx of generalist species into areas where they would not have been, leading to competition and in some cases interbreeding/incorporation of a population into another. In this way, habitat fragmentation is essentially an indirect method of introducing species to an area. The hybridization continuum[edit] There is a kind of continuum with three semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without Introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression, and essentially a Hybrid swarm.[31] Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within Wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization. Consequences[edit] Hybridization can be a less discussed way toward extinction than within detection of where a population lies along the hybrid continuum. The dispute of hybridization is how to manage the resulting hybrids. When a population experiences hybridization with substantial introgression, there still exists parent types of each set of individuals. When a complete hybrid swarm is created, all the individuals are hybrids.[citation needed] Management of hybrids[edit] Conservationists disagree on when is the proper time to give up on a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm or to try and save the still existing pure individuals. Once it becomes a complete mixture, we should look to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss.[31] Most leave it as a case-by-case basis, depending on detecting of hybrids within the group. It is nearly impossible to regulate hybridization via policy because hybridization can occur beneficially when it occurs "naturally" and there is the matter of protecting those previously mentioned hybrid swarms because if they are the only remaining evidence of prior species, they need to be conserved as well.[31] Expression of parental traits in hybrids[edit] When two distinct types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., one parent has red flowers, the other has white, and the hybrid, pink flowers).[37] Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or the other (e.g., a bird hybrid might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).[37] In a hybrid, any trait that falls outside the range of parental variation is termed heterotic. Heterotic hybrids do have new traits, that is, they are not intermediate. Positive heterosis produces more robust hybrids, they might be stronger or bigger; while the term negative heterosis refers to weaker or smaller hybrids.[38] Heterosis is common in both animal and plant hybrids. For example, hybrids between a lion and a tigress ("ligers") are much larger than either of the two progenitors, while a tigon (lioness × tiger) is smaller. Also the hybrids between the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and domestic fowl (Gallus gallus) are larger than either of their parents, as are those produced between the common pheasant and hen golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus).[39] Spurs are absent in hybrids of the former type, although present in both parents.[40] Genetic mixing and extinction[edit] Main article: Genetic pollution Regionally developed ecotypes can be threatened with extinction when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This is sometimes called genetic mixing.[41] Hybridization and introgression of new genetic material can lead to the replacement of local genotypes if the hybrids are more fit and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population to such a degree that none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.[42][43] Effect on biodiversity and food security[edit] Main articles: biodiversity and food security In agriculture and animal husbandry, the Green Revolution's use of conventional hybridization increased yields by breeding "high-yielding varieties". The replacement of locally indigenous breeds, compounded with unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding (genetic mixing), has reduced the gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds resulting in the loss of genetic diversity.[44] Since the indigenous breeds are often well-adapted to local extremes in climate and have immunity to local pathogens this can be a significant genetic erosion of the gene pool for future breeding. Therefore, commercial plant geneticists strive to breed "widely adapted" cultivars to counteract this tendency.[45] Limiting factors[edit] A number of conditions exist that limit the success of hybridization, the most obvious is great genetic diversity between most species. But in animals and plants that are more closely related hybridization barriers can include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo.[citation needed] In plants, barriers to hybridization include blooming period differences, different pollinator vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and structural differences of the chromosomes.[46] Mythical, legendary and religious hybrids[edit] Main article: Mythological hybrid Ancient folktales often contain mythological creatures, sometimes these are described as hybrids (e.g., hippogriff as the offspring of a griffin and a horse, and the Minotaur which is the offspring of Pasiphaë and a white bull). More often they are kind of chimera, i.e., a composite of the physical attributes of two or more kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and often humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, e.g., harpies, mermaids, and centaurs. In the Bible, the Old Testament contains several passages which talk about a first generation of hybrid giants who were known as the Nephilim.[47] The Book of Genesis (6:4) states that "the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them". As a result, the offspring was born as hybrid giants who became mighty heroes of old and legendary famous figures of ancient times.[48] In addition, the Book of Numbers (13:33) says that the descendants of Anak came from the Nephilim, whose bodies looked exactly like men, but with an enormous height. According to the apocryphal Book of Enoch the Nephilim were wicked sons of fallen angels who had lusted with attractive women.[49] See also[edit] Biology portal Artificial selection Bird hybrids Cabbit Canid hybrid Chimera (genetics) Chloroplast capture (botany) Felid hybrids F1 hybrids Genetic admixture Genetic erosion Grex (horticulture) Heterosis (hybrid vigor) Hybrid lovebird Hybrid (mythology) Hybrid name (botany) Hybrid speciation Hybrid swarm Hybrid zone Hybrot Inbreeding Interspecific pregnancy Intraspecific breeding Macropod hybrids Purebred Selective breeding Sheep-goat hybrids Species barrier Synergy References[edit] ^ "Hybrid".

In the Isla Multiespacio stands the highest office tower in the Midwest, the skyscraper would be 142 m initially but then they decided to increase the height to 245 m and 65 floors, is the second tallest building in Venezuela (the first is Parque central east tower with 262.5 m) built the first private theater in the country and a hotel designed for guests with joy social areas looking at the city from above, among other projects. The Isla Multiespacio is a new architectural concept that rescues cheerful city life and safety of the city. Its design focuses for the first time in the country: a mall (street mall), a hotel, a theater, an office tower, a building integrative medicine and aesthetics and a parking structure. Contents 1 Corporate Tower 2 5-star Hotel 3 Private Theater 4 Mall 5 Integrative Medicine Clinic and Aesthetic 6 Parking Structure 7 See also Corporate Tower[edit] IME Corporate Tower, also called office tower stands as the highest city, 245 meters and 65 floors and the 2nd of Venezuela. Their offices up to 750 m2, on the top floors, allow a panoramic view of the city and Lake Valencia. We have designed a system that will allow the proper flow of the elevators to ensure fast and efficient service that will present six-art elevators that run 5.6 meters per second and faster labor dynamics. 5-star Hotel[edit] The hotel plans to have 300 rooms: 290 double rooms, each with more than 36 m2, 9 Suites of 68 m2 and 174 m2 presidential suite. The total area of 23,897 m2 includes: 7 rooms (3 conference rooms of 222.80 m2, 206.82 m2 and 392.50 m2 and 4 meeting rooms of 32.92 m2 each). In the lobby there will be: a restaurant, a bar and another restaurant mezzanine (1,000 m2) + breakfast room. On the top floor will concentrate the most chic hotel: skybar, pool, spa, gym, cafeteria, swimming pool, pool terrace, solarium and a lounge of 500 m2 on the top floor. The hotel is going to have 150 m height and 35 floors. Private Theater[edit] It is the first private theater of Venezuela. By far seems to be suspended in the air. A grandstand, which serves as the main entrance and space for outdoor functions, it rises to nearly 5 feet above the ground, a second characteristic that makes it unique in the country. The foyer of the first floor is a lookout while the ground floor is the entrance to the main hall that can accommodate 1,200 seats. The space of the pit bleachers folds to become a hall of 1,500 m2 approximate to 853 m2 that can be added to the mezzanine to become a great hall show or a convention center. Its versatility allows assembly and development of 2 shows at the same time. The stage height (25 meters freestyle) can comfortably accommodate standing, an elephant. Like all theater has areas for meetings and rehearsals. Mall[edit] The commercial center of 22,206 m2 is divided into 4 modules buildings with enclosed areas and outdoor simulate urban shopping streets typical of a few decades ago, with neon signs, personality facades, terraces, artisans and artists creative full fatigues. In total will have an area of more than 180 shops including food court, restaurants and movie theaters in August of 2205 m2 VIP. Integrative Medicine Clinic and Aesthetic[edit] It has 12 floors with offices focused on the inner and outer beauty in an area of 3,600 m2 with the advantage of being located 5 minutes from the industrial park, the airport, the flying club and 10 minutes of the 3 major universities in the region, which allows a break of aesthetics at any time of day; way to work or school, at noon or late afternoon.

It currently[update] serves in the field artillery role with 16 Air Assault Brigade, and is equipped with the L118 Light Gun. The regiment was constituted in 1961 out of existing batteries that have served continuously since the Napoleonic Wars. Contents 1 History 2 Batteries 3 See also 4 References 5 External links History[edit] The regiment was formed on 27 June 1961 with the re-designation of 33rd Parachute Light Regiment Royal Artillery as 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The regiment first saw action in the middle-east in Kuwait in 1961 and then in Aden in 1963–65 where it was involved in fierce fighting in the Radfan mountains. The 1970s and 80’s saw the regiment involved in four Northern Ireland tours in the infantry role as well as a period where they briefly lost their airborne status and were arms-plotted to Germany until 1984 when they joined newly formed 5th Airborne Brigade and returned to Aldershot.[1] In 1994 the regiment deployed to Cyprus as part of the UN mission to patrol the buffer-zone between Cypriot and Turkish forces. This was followed in 1996–97 with two battery deployments to Bosnia as part of the NATO mission and the Kosovo campaign of 1999.[1] Since the formation of 16 Air Assault Brigade in 1999, 7 Para RHA has been involved in numerous overseas operations. The Sierra Leone campaign in summer 2000 was followed by Op Essential Harvest in Macedonia a year later and then two batteries deployed to the Kabul area of Afghanistan in early 2002.[1] On the afternoon of 19 March 2003 7 Para RHA fired the first shots of the Iraq war by any coalition ground forces. The next day they crossed the border in support of the US I Marine Expeditionary Force. The regiment was instrumental in securing the strategic Rumalya oilfields and supporting the MEF in their move north to Nasiriyah.[2][3][4][5] 7 Parachute Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery gunners fire their 105mm Light Gun at Taliban positions in Afghanistan during August 2008 In late 2003 the regiment moved from Aldershot to Colchester to join the rest of 16 Air Assault Brigade. 2006 saw the first of the regiment's three tours of Afghanistan. The first of these saw the regiment play a key role in the break into Helmand province. This tour attracted much public attention and has often been described as the most intense combat fighting since the Korean War of the 1950s. The regiment returned to Helmand two years later and were again involved in heavy fighting – cumulating in the large scale operation to move a turbine from Kandahar along a heavily mined and fiercely defended road to the Kajaki Dam. 7 Para RHA’s final deployment to Afghanistan saw the Regiment’s gun groups and Fire Support Teams deploy to central Helmand Province in order to provide offensive support to 16th Air Assault Brigade.[6] In May 2013, V Battery was disbanded.[7] In September 2013, it was part of Exercise Sphinx Resolve.[8] Batteries[edit] The batteries are as follows:[9] F (Sphinx) Parachute Battery Royal Horse Artillery G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery I Parachute Battery (Bull's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery (Headquarters battery) Light Aid Detachment, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Coordinates: 51°52.366?N 0°52.985?E? / ?51.872767°N 0.883083°E? / 51.872767; 0.883083?

Contents 1 Etymology 2 Zaraitzu Basque 3 Municipalities 4 Demographics 5 References 6 External links Etymology[edit] The first mention of the name was in documents of the Monastery of Leire, with the denomination of Sarasazo (924). Later Sarasazu (1055), Sarasaz (1111 and 1469), Sarasaitz (1205) especially in texts written in Latin. Zaraitzu seems to derivate from an older form: Sarasaitzu. The Castilian official denomination began being used widely in the 17th century probably influenced by the Salazar surname, famous in the Nobility of the Iberian Peninsula. In fact Salazar is not a common surname in Navarre, but it is very common in the west of the Basque Country, which indicates its origins. Zaraitzu Basque[edit] The local Basque language dialect was the Salazarese, although nowadays Spanish among the elder population and Spanish and Euskara Batua between younger generations is spoken. However, the last publications of works about the Basque of Zaraitzu (dictionary, learning method, text collection and oral recordings) and some courses of this dialect in the valley have been addressed to the local population in order to maintain it to some extent.

The Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children was an honor presented to recording artists for quality children's music albums at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.[1] Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".[2]

Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children Awarded for quality children's music albums Country United States Presented by National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences First awarded 1994 Last awarded 2011 Official website grammy.com The Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children was an honor presented to recording artists for quality children's music albums at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.[1] Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".[2] The award for Best Musical Album for Children was first presented to producer Alan Menken and Tim Rice in 1994 for the soundtrack to the Disney film Aladdin. The award was discontinued from 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. Starting in 2012, this category merged with the Best Spoken Word Album for Children category to form the new Best Children's Album category. This merger meant essentially returning to the categorization set-up prior to 1994 (although with a small name change), when recordings for children was covered by the Grammy Award for Best Album for Children alone.

Rayner Hoff
George Rayner Hoff (27 November 1894 – 19 November 1937) was a sculptor who worked in Australia. He fought in World War I and is chiefly known for his war memorial work, particularly the sculptures on the ANZAC War Memorial in Sydney.

George Rayner Hoff (27 November 1894 – 19 November 1937) was a sculptor who worked in Australia. He fought in World War I and is chiefly known for his war memorial work, particularly the sculptures on the ANZAC War Memorial in Sydney. Contents 1 Early life and training 2 Australian work 3 Architectural Sculpture 4 Other works 5 Death 6 Further reading 7 References Early life and training[edit] Hoff was born on the Isle of Man, the son of a stone and wood carver of Dutch descent. He began helping his father on architectural commissions at a very young age and briefly attended the Nottingham School of Art where he studied drawing, design, and modelling, from 1910 to 1915. During World War I he was in the British Army and fought in the trenches in France, an experience from which he was to draw most passionately in the creation of his various war memorials. Later in the war he made maps based on aerial photographs. Returning from the trenches following the War he enrolled in the Royal College of Art in London studying under Francis Derwent Wood for three years. In 1922, Hoff won the British Prix de Rome which allowed him the opportunity to study in Rome. There he did little work in sculpture beyond making sketch models, but drew much and mentally studied the many examples of classical and Renaissance art to be found in that country. In May 1923, on the recommendation of Sir George Frampton, R.A., and F. Derwent Wood, R.A., he became director of sculpture and drawing at the East Sydney Technical College (Australia) and set up his private studio. In 1933, he was named the head of the ESTC Art School. Australian work[edit] Hoff came to Australia as a young man of 28. He soon adapted himself to Australian conditions, and his quiet, slightly whimsical personality made him generally liked. He was a quick worker and an artist of great originality, although his work, originally based on the Greeks, shows he had paid attention to tradition. He had studied much that was best in Italian work of the Renaissance, the Assyrian friezes, the attempt to retain only the essentials, characteristic of some of the moderns, and the simple sincerity of the Chinese. His modelling is in a lyrical, classical art-deco manner which effortlessly combines sensuous curves with geometric line patterns. Hoff's coming to Sydney was a great gain to Australia. He speedily reorganized the school and succeeded in winning the enthusiasm of the students. He became a member of the Society of Artists and sent work to their exhibitions. In 1924 he designed their medal, and in 1927 was responsible for sculpture for the National War Memorial at Adelaide. In the same year he was awarded the Wynne prize at Sydney. His best known works are the figures on the exterior of the ANZAC War Memorial in Hyde Park, Sydney, the central group in the interior, and the bronze reliefs. The figures on the exterior and the interior group, including Sacrifice, are cited by sculptor, Ron Robertson-Swann as "Sydney's most moving example of publicly visible architecture".[1] Art historian, Professor Virginia Spate, wrote in 1999: "Even incomplete, [it] is the most perfect sculptural monument in Australia."[2] An example of his sculpture associated with architecture is at the University of Sydney, where four medallion portraits of great scientists are on the façade of the physics building. Rayner also produced a variety of smaller work, built up a fine school of sculpture, and in 1934 was commissioned to design the Victorian centenary medal. His use of a ram's head as the design for one side of it was much criticized, and it is not one of his most successful efforts. At the time of his death on 19 November 1937 he was engaged on the George V Memorial for Canberra. He had recently been commissioned to design part of the new coinage for the Commonwealth. Among his works is the emblem of the Holden Australian car company, a stylised 'Lion and Stone' symbol representing a legend of man's invention of the wheel. Architectural Sculpture[edit] The ANZAC War Memorial, completed in 1934, is the main commemorative military monument in Sydney, designed by C. Bruce Dellit, has an exterior adorned with monumental figural reliefs and sculptures by Rayner Hoff, and is arguably the finest Art Deco structure in Australia.

Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd
Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [1947] KB 130 (or the High Trees case) is an English contract law decision in the High Court. It reaffirmed and extended the doctrine of promissory estoppel in contract law in England and Wales.
High Trees case Court King's Bench Division Decided 18 July 1946 Citation(s) [1947] KB 130; [1956] 1 All ER 256; 62 TLR 557; [1947] LJR 77; 175 LT 333 Court membership Judge(s) sitting Denning J Keywords Promissory estoppel Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [1947] KB 130 (or the High Trees case) is an English contract law decision in the High Court. It reaffirmed and extended the doctrine of promissory estoppel in contract law in England and Wales. Denning J held estoppel to be: a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on. Contents 1 Facts 2 Judgment 3 Significance 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Facts[edit] In 1937, High Trees House Ltd leased a block of flats in Clapham, London, for a rate £2500/year from Central London Property Trust Ltd. Due to the conditions during the beginning of World War II occupancy rates were drastically lower than normal. In January 1940, to ameliorate the situation, the parties made an agreement in writing to reduce rent by half. However, neither party stipulated the period for which this reduced rental was to apply. Over the next five years, High Trees paid the reduced rate while the flats began to fill, and by 1945, the flats were back at full occupancy. Central London sued for payment of the full rental costs from June 1945 onwards (i.e. for last two quarters of 1945). Judgment[edit] Based on previous judgments as Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co, Denning J held that the full rent was payable from the time that the flats became fully occupied in mid-1945. However, he continued in an obiter statement that if Central London had tried to claim for the full rent from 1940 onwards, they would not have been able to. This was reasoned on the basis that if a party leads another party to believe that he will not enforce his strict legal rights, then the Courts will prevent him from doing so at a later stage. Being obiter dicta, this remark was not actually a binding precedent, yet it essentially created the doctrine of promissory estoppel. If I were to consider this matter without regard to recent developments in the law, there is no doubt that had the plaintiffs claimed it, they would have been entitled to recover ground rent at the rate of £2,500 a year from the beginning of the term, since the lease under which it was payable was a lease under seal which, according to the old common law, could not be varied by an agreement by parol (whether in writing or not), but only by deed. Equity, however stepped in, and said that if there has been a variation of a deed by a simple contract (which in the case of a lease required to be in writing would have to be evidenced by writing), the courts may give effect to it as is shown in Berry v. Berry [1929] 2 K. B. 316. That equitable doctrine, however, could hardly apply in the present case because the variation here might be said to have been made without consideration. With regard to estoppel, the representation made in relation to reducing the rent was not a representation of an existing fact. It was a representation, in effect, as to the future, namely, that payment of the rent would not be enforced at the full rate but only at the reduced rate. Such a representation would not give rise to an estoppel, because, as was said in Jorden v. Money (1854) 5 H. L. C. 185, a representation as to the future must be embodied as a contract or be nothing. But what is the position in view of developments in the law in recent years? The law has not been standing still since Jorden v. Money (1854) 5 H. L. C. 185. There has been a series of decisions over the last fifty years which, although they are said to be cases of estoppel are not really such. They are cases in which a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on. In such cases the courts have said that the promise must be honoured. The cases to which I particularly desire to refer are: Fenner v. Blake [1900] 1 Q. B. 426, In re Wickham (1917) 34 T. L. R. 158, Re William Porter & Co., Ld. [1937] 2 All E. R. 361 and Buttery v. Pickard [1946] W. N. 25. As I have said they are not cases of estoppel in the strict sense. They are really promises - promises intended to be binding, intended to be acted on, and in fact acted on. Jorden v. Money (1854) 5 H. L. C. 185 can be distinguished, because there the promisor made it clear that she did not intend to be legally bound, whereas in the cases to which I refer the proper inference was that the promisor did intend to be bound. In each case the court held the promise to be binding on the party making it, even though under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it. The courts have not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise, but they have refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it. It is in that sense, and that sense only, that such a promise gives rise to an estoppel. The decisions are a natural result of the fusion of law and equity: for the cases of Hughes v. Metropolitan Ry. Co. (1877) 2 App. Cas. 439 , 448, Birmingham and District Land Co. v. London & North Western Ry. Co. (1888) 40 Ch. D. 268 , 286 and Salisbury (Marquess) v. Gilmore [1942] 2 K. B. 38 , 51, afford a sufficient basis for saying that a party would not be allowed in equity to go back on such a promise. In my opinion, the time has now come for the validity of such a promise to be recognized. The logical consequence, no doubt is that a promise to accept a smaller sum in discharge of a larger sum, if acted upon, is binding notwithstanding the absence of consideration: and if the fusion of law and equity leads to this result, so much the better. That aspect was not considered in Foakes v. Beer (1884) 9 App. Cas. 605. At this time of day however, when law and equity have been joined together for over seventy years, principles must be reconsidered in the light of their combined effect. It is to be noticed that in the Sixth Interim Report of the Law Revision Committee, pars. 35, 40, it is recommended that such a promise as that to which I have referred should be enforceable in law even though no consideration for it has been given by the promisee. It seems to me that, to the extent I have mentioned, that result has now been achieved by the decisions of the courts. I am satisfied that a promise such as that to which I have referred is binding and the only question remaining for my consideration is the scope of the promise in the present case. I am satisfied on all the evidence that the promise here was that the ground rent should be reduced to £1,250 a year as a temporary expedient while the block of flats was not fully, or substantially fully let, owing to the conditions prevailing. That means that the reduction in the rent applied throughout the years down to the end of 1944, but early in 1945 it is plain that the flats were fully let, and, indeed the rents received from them (many of them not being affected by the Rent Restrictions Acts), were increased beyond the figure at which it was originally contemplated that they would be let. At all events the rent from them must have been very considerable. I find that the conditions prevailing at the time when the reduction in rent was made, had completely passed away by the early months of 1945. I am satisfied that the promise was understood by all parties only to apply under the conditions prevailing at the time when it was made, namely, when the flats were only partially let, and that it did not extend any further than that. When the flats became fully let, early in 1945, the reduction ceased to apply. In those circumstances, under the law as I hold it, it seems to me that rent is payable at the full rate for the quarters ending September 29 and December 25, 1945. If the case had been one of estoppel, it might be said that in any event the estoppel would cease when the conditions to which the representation applied came to an end, or it also might be said that it would only come to an end on notice. In either case it is only a way of ascertaining what is the scope of the representation. I prefer to apply the principle that a promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted on and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms properly apply. Here it was binding as covering the period down to the early part of 1945, and as from that time full rent is payable. I therefore give judgment for the plaintiff company for the amount claimed. Significance[edit] Attempts have been made to utilize the doctrine of promissory estoppel after High Trees to create a new inroad into the rule in Pinnel's case that an agreement to accept part payment of a debt in full satisfaction of it is unenforceable for want of consideration. In the High Trees case Lord Denning commented, obiter, that such an agreement should now be enforceable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. However, the courts have traditionally been reluctant to overrule cases like Pinnel's case and Foakes v Beer as they have formed part of the common law for so long. Lady Justice Arden in Collier v P & MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd[1] accepted in principle that High Trees could be used to extinguish a creditor's right to full payment of a debt in such circumstances. In Amalgamated Investment Co v Texas Bank[2] it was held that the doctrine could act as a sword and not merely as a shield (that is, it could be used as a cause of action rather than merely providing a defence to an action).

McGillivray syndrome
McGillivray syndrome is a very rare syndrome which is also known as a Craniosynostosis. It is characterized mainly by heart defects, skull and facial abnormalities and ambiguous genitalia. The symptoms of this syndrome are ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, small jaw, undescended testes, and webbed fingers. Beside to these symptoms there are more symptoms which is related with bone structure and misshape. It was first recovered by modern understanding of craniosynostosis is referenced from the 1851 writings of Virchow. His understanding and descriptions of irregular calvarial growth patterns were the basis of the law of Virchow. The patients could be diagnosed by A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the cranial sutures, slow or no growth of the head as the baby grows, development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, and increased pressure within the skull (intracranial pressure). This could be cured by various surgeries.

External links and Citations About McGillivray McGillivray McGillivray syndrome is a birth defect in which one or more of the joints between the bones of your baby's skull close prematurely, before your baby's brain is fully formed. When your baby has craniosynostosis, his or her brain can't grow in its natural shape and the head is misshapen. It can affect one or more of the joints in your baby's skull. In some cases, craniosynostosis is associated with an underlying brain abnormality that prevents the brain from growing properly. Treating McGillivray usually involves surgery to separate the fused bones. If there's no underlying brain abnormality, the surgery allows baby’s brain to grow and develop in adequate space. Symptoms Your baby's skull has seven bones. Normally, these bones don't fuse until around age 2, giving your baby's brain time to grow. Joints called cranial sutures, made of strong, fibrous tissue, hold these bones together. In the front of your baby's skull, the sutures intersect in the large soft spot (fontanel) on the top of your baby's head. Normally, the sutures remain flexible until the bones fuse. The signs of craniosynostosis may not be noticeable at birth, but they become apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. The symptoms differs from types of synostosis. First of all there is Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the suture at the top of the head (sagittal suture) forces the head to grow long and narrow, rather than wide. Scaphocephaly is the most common type of craniosynostosis. The other one is called Coronal synostosis (anterior plagiocephaly). Premature fusion of a coronal suture — one of the structures that run from each ear to the sagittal suture on top of the head — may force your baby's forehead to flatten on the affected side. It may also raise the eye socket and cause a deviated nose and slanted skull. The Bicoronal synostosis (brachycephaly). When both of the coronal sutures fuse prematurely, your baby may have a flat, elevated forehead and brow. Rare types and characteristics[edit] There are two less common types of McGillivray syndromes are: Metopic synostosis (trigonocephaly). The metopic suture runs from your baby's nose to the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the scalp a triangular appearance. Another one is Lambdoid synostosis (posterior plagiocephaly). This rare form of craniosynostosis involves the lambdoid suture, which runs across the skull near the back of the head. It may cause flattening of your baby's head on the affected side. A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of birth trauma or your baby's spending too much time on his or her back. This condition is sometimes treated with a custom-fit helmet that helps mold your baby's head back into a normal position. History McGillivray Syndrome is referenced from the 1851 writings of Virchow. His understanding and descriptions of irregular calvarial growth patterns were the basis of the law of Virchow. According to his observations, the abnormal cranial growth observed in persons with craniosynostosis occurs perpendicular to the involved calvarial sutures. Therefore, if a suture line is prematurely ossified, no growth is present in the direction perpendicular to that suture. Surgical treatment for craniosynostosis was initially advocated by Lannelongue in 1890. His patients had microcephaly from craniosynostosis and were thought to be imbeciles. These patients accordingly underwent craniectomy to remove the involved suture line and to "release the brain". Soon after, in 1891, linear craniectomy was introduced. As with any new procedure, this one met with much resistance. However, the resistance to a surgical intervention was slowly put to rest with mounting evidence. Several studies indicated that craniosynostectomy was the treatment of choice for the release of fused suture lines in the skull. Studies showed that, over time, cranial suture areas excised during strip craniectomy still became fused and led to an abnormal cranial contour. Strip craniectomy was easier and involved less blood loss compared with the newer cranial vault reconstruction. Strip craniectomy also did not address the frontal bossing and associated abnormalities in calvarial shape and relied on the rapid growth of the brain to correct it. Strip craniectomy was optimal only in the first few months of infancy, while surgeons could use cranial vault reconstruction throughout infancy. Consequently, strip craniectomy lost favor, and the surgical treatment has been modified to include cranial vault remodeling. Recently, with the advent of endoscopy, attention has returned to endoscopic strip craniectomy. The endoscopic technique has only been tried over the last several years, but it offers the advantages of a shorter and safer operation, less cost, less in-hospital time, and less blood loss. The operation was shown to be a success in a study of 12 patients, all younger than 8 months. Critical to this success and a departure from the standard strip craniosynostectomy was the extensive use of a postoperative remodeling helmet. Although first introduced by Persing et al. in 1986, helmet therapy has not been used as extensively as a postoperative therapeutic intervention. Tests and Diagnosis First of all there is physical exam. Doctors examine baby’s head for abnormalities such as suture ridges and look the facial deformities. Also, they utilizes Computerized Tomography which scan of the baby’s skull. Fused sutures are identifiable by their absences. X-rays also may be used to measure precise dimensions of your baby's skull, using a technique called cephalometry. Genetic testing. If your doctor suspects your baby's misshapen skull is caused by an underlying hereditary syndrome, genetic testing may help identify the syndrome.Genetic tests usually require a blood sample. Depending on what type of abnormality is suspected, your doctor may take a sample of your baby's hair, skin or other tissue, such as cells from the inside of the cheek. The sample is sent to a lab for analysis. Treatments and Drugs The major treatment is surgery for most babies. The type of surgery which they would undergo differs from age and strength they have. The main reason of doing the surgery is to alleviate pressure on the brain, and create a space for brain developing and growing. It would improve infant’s appearance. The first one is Traditional surgery. During surgeon, they make incision in baby's scalp and cranial bones, and reshapes the portion of the skull. Sometimes plates and screws, often made of material that is absorbed over time, are used to hold the bones in place. Surgery, which is performed during general anesthesia, usually takes hours. After surgery, your baby remains in the hospital for at least three days. Some children may require a second surgery later because, the craniosynostosis recurs. Also, children with facial deformities often require future surgeries to reshape their faces. Another one is Endoscopic surgery. This less invasive form of surgery isn't an option for everyone. But in certain cases, the surgeon may use a lighted tube (endoscope) inserted through one or two small scalp incisions over the affected suture. The surgeon then opens the suture to enable your baby's brain to grow normally. Endoscopic surgery usually takes about an hour, causes less swelling and blood loss, and shortens the hospital stay, often to one day after surgery.

In the course of the event, a Shiite Arab militia, accompanied by Bedouin from a nearby village, attacked the Jewish agricultural locality of Tel Hai. In the aftermath of the battle eight Jews and five Arabs were killed. Joseph Trumpeldor, the commander of Jewish defenders of Tel Hai, was shot in the hand and stomach, and died while being evacuated to Kfar Giladi that evening. Tel Hai was eventually abandoned by the Jews and burned by the Arab militia. The event is perceived by some scholars as the first significant outbreak of violence, eventually leading to the Arab–Israeli conflict three decades later. Contents 1 Background 2 History 2.1 Battle 3 Aftermath 4 Significance 4.1 Trumpeldor's heritage 5 See also 6 References 7 External links 8 Further reading Background[edit] Tel Hai had been intermittently inhabited since 1905 and was permanently settled as a border outpost in 1918, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I.[clarification needed] The area was subsequently subject to intermittent border adjustments between the British and the French. The Franco-Syrian War took place in early 1920 between Syrian Arab nationalists, under the Hashemite King, and France. Gangs ('isabat) of clan-based border peasants, combining politics and banditry, were active in the area of the loosely defined border between the soon to be established Mandatory Palestine, French Mandate of Lebanon and Syria.[1] Joseph Trumpedor had served as an officer in the Russian Army during the Russian-Japanese War of 1905, being one of the few Russian Jews to gain a commission under the Tzar. He had also commanded a Jewish auxiliary unit fighting together with the British Army during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War. As such, he was a well experienced military man, whom the Zionist movement could send to command the threatened outpost. History[edit] At the beginning of the Franco-Syrian War, the Upper Galilee was populated by several semi-nomadic Bedouin Arab tribes, the largest residing in Halasa, and four tiny Jewish settlements, including Metula, Kfar Giladi, Tel Hai and Hamra. While the Arab villages and Bedouin allied with the Arab Kingdom of Syria, the Jewish residents chose to remain neutral during the Arab conflict with the French. Early on the war, a Kfar Giladi resident was killed by armed Bedouin, greatly increasing tension in the region. Jewish villages were regularly pillaged by the pro-Syrian Bedouin on the pretext of searching for "French spies and soldiers." In one incident, Trumpeldor and other Jews were stripped of their clothes as a public insult by an Arab Bedouin militia.[citation needed] Battle[edit] On March 1, 1920, several hundred Shiite Arabs from the village of Jabal Amil in southern Lebanon marched to the gates of Tel Hai together with Bedouin from Halasa and their Mukhtar, Kamal Affendi . They demanded to search Tel Hai for French soldiers. One of the farmers fired a shot into the air, a signal for reinforcements from nearby Kfar Giladi, which brought ten men led by Trumpeldor, who had been posted by Hashomer to organize defense.[2] Joseph Trumpeldor and his ten men attempted to influence the Shiites and roving village militias to go away through negotiation. In mainstream Zionist historiography, the Arabs' demand to search Tel Hai was a ruse, and the real intention was intelligence-gathering, murder and driving out the Jews. Kamal Affendi was allowed to enter the village to search for "French soldiers." He encountered one of the female Jewish residents named Deborah who pointed a pistol at Kamal, apparently surprised to see an armed Bedouin in the village. A shot was discharged during the struggle (unclear whether from the pistol or by another weapon) and a major firefight erupted. Trumpeldor was shot and seriously wounded, while the sides barricaded themselves in the village. Kamal Affendi asked to leave, saying it was all a misunderstanding, and the Jewish force approved the cease-fire. During the Arab retreat, one of the Jewish defenders, unaware of the agreements by his comrades and hearing-impaired by the previous firefight, shot at the Arab party, and the exchange of fire recommenced. Six Jews and five Arabs were killed in the fighting. Trumpeldor was shot in the hand and stomach, and died while being evacuated to Kfar Giladi that evening. The survivors of Tel Hai found their position untenable and had no choice but to withdraw, whereupon the Arabs set fire to the village.[3] Aftermath[edit] The eight Jews, killed at Tel Hai (this number including two killed in a previous probing attack in January 1920), were buried in two common graves in Kfar Giladi, and both locations were abandoned for a time.[2] On 3 March Kfar Giladi was also attacked by a large group of Bedouin. The defenders abandoned the position and retreated to the Shia village of Taibe where they were given shelter and an escort to Ayelet Hashahar which was under British control.[4] The Franco-Syrian War entered its last stages in July 1920, with the defeat of Hashemites in the Battle of Maysalun. The border in the area of Upper Galilee was finally agreed between the British and the French, and this area was to be included in Mandatory Palestine. It was thus possible for Tel Hai to be resettled in 1921, though it did not become a viable independent community and in 1926 it was absorbed into the kibbutz of Kfar Giladi. With a national monument in Upper Galilee, Israel commemorates the deaths of eight Jews, six men and two women, including Joseph Trumpeldor. The memorial is best known for an emblematic statue of a defiant lion representing Trumpeldor and his comrades. The city of Kiryat Shemona, literally Town of the Eight was named after them. Significance[edit] The incident is often considered the first violent incident of the Arab–Israeli conflict. Idith Zertal has written that it marked 'the dramatic initiation of the violent conflict over Palestine.'[5] Trumpeldor's heritage[edit] See also: Joseph Trumpeldor § Tel Hai Trumpeldor was severely wounded and died after several hours. He is traditionally credited with having said before dying "No matter, it is good to die (tov lamut) for our country" ("??? ???, ??? ???? ??? ?????") words which in Zionist and Israeli collective memory remain closely associated with the names "Trumpeldor" and "Tel Hai". A recent theory has argued that Trumpeldor's last words were in fact a pungent curse in his mother-tongue Russian, reflecting frustration with his bad luck, namely 'F**k your mother' ((Yob tvoyú mat'),:?? ???? ????! ).[6] The words attributed to Trumpeldor, moreover, are clearly a variant of the well known saying "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" ("It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country"), derived from the Odes of the Roman poet Horace – lines with which Trumpeldor, like other educated Europeans of the time, may have been familiar with.

He clearly had innate talent, winning first prize for drawing at his primary school; but having gained his certificat d’études, he was forced to start work rather than continuing with his studies. His mother wanted him to be a pastry chef, a profession she thought would be useful for the family restaurant. The young man refused and got his first job as an apprentice painter at a carriage maker’s. His second was as a house painter. After that he finally found a job that suited him with a picture restorer. This was where his taste for painting was confirmed, and he decided to make it his career. Here he learned the rudiments of easel painting as he accompanied his employer on his trips to paint after nature. Early years[edit] Balande’s artistic training gained new impetus with the intervention of Alfred Goutureaud, abbot of Royan and an amateur painter, who in 1900 introduced him to his former teacher, Henri-Joseph Harpignies, arranging a meeting in Paris, at the Exposition Universelle. Harpignies wrote a letter of recommendation for his protégé to the director of the École des Beaux-Arts to enable him to improve his drawing. His first lessons were not enough to gain him access to the École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs; so, pending the next session, in March 1901, Balande went back to his hand-to-mouth jobs, working in a sign painting workshop for two francs a day. At the end of these strenuous working days he took evening courses at the design school in Rue Étienne Marcel. He visited Harpignies several times to have his progress assessed. As Balande would recall in his memoirs, ‘I showed him my work from the evening classes, and he encouraged me! And before I left, he poured me a good glass of vintage wine and put a louis d’or in my hand, saying “I don’t like poverty.” This encouragement and generosity bore fruit: a few weeks later, Balande was admitted to the École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs, having come fifth in the entrance examination. At last, he would benefit from a professional artistic training. But even now he was only able to attend the evening course, since he needed to work in the day to support himself. War period[edit] In 1902 Balande was passed fit for military service. Forced to give up his courses at the Arts Décoratifs, he was initially posted to assist the medical corps in Bordeaux. Then he was transferred to La Rochelle, where he met the painter Furcy de Lavaux, who was also the curator of the city’s fine arts museum, and who invited him to take evening courses in drawing. No sooner had Balande begun working as a nurse in the Aufrédi hospital than he was transferred, this time to the 22nd section at Val-de-Grâce, Paris. A wealthy corporal in the barracks commissioned his first painting, Coucher de soleil sur la Seudre à Ribérou. Balande submitted it to the Salon des Artistes Français, but it was refused. He would later regret this hasty submission; though the jury was soon to recognize his promising talent. After the war, Balande returned to Paris and went back to his evening courses at the École des Arts Décoratifs and frequented the atelier of Jean-Paul Laurens and Australian artist Rupert Bunny. Influenced originally by Puvis de Chavannes, Bunny was essentially a decorative artist and he communicated to Balande skills in working on architectural scale, which were to stand him in good stead throughout a career punctuated by important public commissions. Thanks to the teaching of Laurens and Bunny, Balande made a successful appearance at the Salon des Artistes Français in 1905 with an ambitious painting titled Quai d’Orsay, en hiver, manifesting a technical mastery which showed how far he had come since the failure of 1902. The painting’s merits were recognized by the Académie des Beaux-Arts; the Institut awarded Balande the Edouard Lemaître prize, designated for a landscape artist aged under twenty-five. If Balande’s memoirs are to be believed, Cormon may well have had something to do with this award.10 He recalls going to see the Master in the Rue de Rome, where Cormon reproached him for not presenting himself on the evening they first met, as he had suggested. Cormon nevertheless proposed that he join him at his atelier at the École des Beaux-Arts, which Balande only did officially in 1909. Etaples and the European tour[edit] In the meantime, at the advice of his friend Rupert Bunny, Balande had moved to Étaples, a fishing port in the Pas-de-Calais, home since the 1880s to a veritable international colony of artists, including the French painters Henri Le Sidaner, Jules Adler, Francis Tattegrain and Victor-Ferdinand Bourgeois. When Balande joined the group, the ‘School of Étaples’ was at its apogee. The location afforded its artists edifying subjects, primarily the hard-working daily life of fishing communities, which they then presented at the Salon. The artist expressed his emotion in naturalist-style paintings such as Le départ pour la pêche, sent to the Salon in 1907, where it won a second-class medal. This distinction confirmed the awards made by the same jury that same year and 1908. In 1911, the Conseil Supérieur de l’État awarded him the second travel grant, with the support of the Academy member Georges Lecomte. Balande thus began to prepare for a year of travel paid for by the state. His only obligation was to call in at the local French embassies or consulates in order to withdraw his allowance. Before his departure for Belgium and the Netherlands, Cormon recommended that he study the Flemish Primitives and, above all, repeated his exhortation to stop ‘painting in black’ like Gustave Courbet. The paintings that he composed on his return from Spain, his second destination, show that he had indeed moved in this direction. Even so, the tone and atmosphere remain serious, as in most of the canvases from his Spanish travels. That was not the case with the works he painted in Italy and following his time there. He travelled through the Camargue and along the Riviera and entered the peninsula via Genoa, then on to Pisa, travelling down to Florence and as far as Rome, where he recalled the views painted by Corot and Harpignies. Then he set off for Naples. Balande, war painter[edit] Balande’s move towards a lighter style of painting began in 1914 when he was working on his luminous Sur les bords de la Seine. This joyous new élan was cut short by the outbreak of war in 1914. Balande volunteered as an unpaid nurse at the hospital in Saujon. In 1917 the fine arts administration recruited him to go out to the front and paint resonant images of the war. He was sent to Nieuport, in Belgium, and to Verdun, where he composed deeply moving paintings. In this regard, the brutal colours and the line, both sharp and schematic, of his Enterrement à Nieuport are a response to the tragedy of this conflict. But the darkness of the war years did not change the direction he had taken since Italy towards a brighter palette and greater emphasis on light. In spring 1918 the Balande family took refuge in La Rochelle, moving shortly afterwards to the nearby village of Lauzières. This would long remain the painter’s favoured summer retreat. He cycled through the Pays d’Aunis countryside surrounding La Rochelle, much appreciating the unspoilt scenery and character of its people, whom he depicted in everyday scenes. Still showing the soft, smooth touch of his early days, Balande gave his Femmes d’Aunis, a true, touching expression that anticipates the paintings of Brittany by Henri-Alexandre Sollier. Indeed, the two artists were displayed together, along with Paul Deltombe, at the ‘La Victoire’ exhibition organised by Galerie Devambez in 1919. Back in Paris after the war, Balande worked hard to revive his career. In the meantime, the Galerie André and Galerie Marcel Bernheim put on his first major solo exhibitions. Balande also worked to raise his profile in various Parisian salons, showing for the first time at the Salon des Indépendants in 1921, at the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1924, and at the Salon des Tuileries in 1926. It was therefore necessary to paint large quantities of canvases to supply these various events. Partly for this reason, the 1920s and 1930s were by far his most productive years. His stature was confirmed by two invitations to the Venice Biennale as well as numerous solo and group shows abroad – in Brazil, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and the United States, where he was shown in Pittsburgh alongside Georges Braque, Picasso and Vlaminck. In 1929 Balande travelled to Morocco, crossing the country from east to west and making many colourful studies on his way. Otherwise, he recharged his creative batteries at his holiday home in Lauzières-sur-Mer, where the surrounding countryside and nearby harbour at La Rochelle became his open-air studio at Easter and in the summer months. It was here, in 1920, that he met Albert Marquet. The painter was spending the summer at the Pays d’Ouest hotel, having been invited down by Paul Signac, then renting a house in La Rochelle. Balande and Marquet became friends and the older Master invited him to accompany him on his painting sessions, working from life. This collaboration deeply affected Balande, and his paintings of the 1920s are strongly influenced by Marquet and his keen sense of values. Between Paris and Lauzières[edit] At the start of the 1920s, in his Parisian studio on Boulevard Arago, Balande started working on ambitious decorative compositions which, for him, represented a new approach to monumental painting. In 1921 the first results of this new direction were sent to the Salon des Artistes Français in the form of Un beau jour d’été. The canvas was immediately acquired by the state and included in its permanent exhibition at the Musée du Luxembourg, the forerunner of today’s Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. Critics compared the work to Manet, likening the composition of the bathers sitting by the waterside to that of the leisurely figures in Le déjeuner sur l’herbe. Of course, the work’s innovative quality was not due to this connection, to which one could easily add a link to Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, but to its novel synthesis between the classical landscape tradition and the modernity of Paul Cézanne. Balande had begun comprehensively exploring the area of Mantes when he acquired a studio in a farm at Senneville, a village in the Eure, in 1925. As at Lauzières, he patiently created a flower garden which he would then paint on numerous occasions. The flowers he picked were arranged in vases to become the central motif of several still lifes. He painted some of the most personal and accomplished landscapes of his career showing the countryside around the Seine at Senneville. Until the Second World War, his depictions of the Île de France would display the rich, vibrant touch characteristic of his artistic maturity. Towards posterity[edit] The official presentation of Camping to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts gained him sociétaire status at its Salon. Balande ended the year of 1935 with a pleasant cruise around the Mediterranean during which he discovered Sicily and, above all, Venice, where he created paintings of real sensitivity. He painted the Palais des doges from the landing stage of the ship, which explains the low angle. The year preceding the cruise, in Normandy, he painted the cliff at Etretat. The perspective from the top of the cliffs is vertiginous, and matches the spectacular and prestigious nature of the painting’s final destination: this was in fact a decorative panel commissioned in 1934 by the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, for whom it would decorate the Salon d’écriture in the first class quarters of the legendary Normandie, the liner whose lavish decoration kept the cream of French artistic talent busy for several years. His painting was such an immediate success upon its installation that he made a second version, which was shown at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, in 1936. No sooner had Balande completed his painting for the Normandie than he was asked to produce paintings for the dining room of another liner, the De Grasse. His consummate skill in landscape painting is something that Balande passed on to his foreign students at the American School at the Château de Fontainebleau. Teaching there from 1926 was a real joy, his plein-air classes in the park and surrounding forest were a delight for teacher and students alike. ‘It is true happiness,’ he wrote. This bliss lasted until France’s declaration of war against Germany in 1939. Balande had spent the preceding months in Greece, painting in the studio provided for him by the director of the art school in Athens, the sculptor Constantinos Dimitriadis. Returning to France, he resumed his duties as curator at the museum in La Rochelle, a position he took up in 1931. The liberation of La Rochelle[edit] When La Rochelle was liberated, on 9 May 1945, Balande celebrated the event with the painting Libération de La Rochelle,61 in which a crowd packs the Place d’Armes now commanded by American tanks. Personal grief shadowed these events: his son André had died from his war wounds in 1941, cutting short a promising career as a painter. Bruised but not vanquished, Balande now set about producing ambitious work that he hoped would position him favourably on the lucrative market of national reconstruction. His Réception du général de Gaulle par la ville de La Rochelle, acquired by the state in 1946, was designed to serve as an artistic calling card and show local decision-makers that he had lost none of his talent for large-scale painting. But he had to wait until 1955 for another public commission, frescoes for a second school in the La Rochelle area. Personal confession[edit] In 1957, Gaston Balande, now aged 77, sold his house at Senneville, leaving only his Parisian studio and the house at Lauzières-sur-Mer, to which he was deeply attached. His last contributions to the Salon des Artistes Français were once more landscapes from Saintonge, showing that his words of 1926 were as true as ever as he entered the twilight of his days: ‘It is the place I love most of all’, he said. ‘I love Charente-Maritime because it is like no other region. Its luminous sky is matchless. It gives its whitewashed houses a brightness that is almost Oriental.’ Comparing these landscapes to those of Brittany, near Saint-Malo, whose splendour he readily acknowledged, he confessed to preferring ‘the simplicity of its Aunisian coast’, where he found ‘all the finesse and distinction’ he needed for his art. Such was the profession of faith of this painter of nature who died in Paris on 8 April 1971. Works in public institutions[edit] Le départ pour la pêche (Etaples), 1907.

His research interests include socio-cultural anthropology, religion and ritual, gender, psychoanalysis, practice, China and Taiwan.[1] Contents 1 Early life 2 Academic career 3 Research 4 Selected publications 4.1 Books and monographs 4.2 Articles in journals 5 Notes Early life[edit] Sangren was born on born April 2, 1946, in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He earned his B.A. from Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University in 1968. After Princeton, he joined the Navy and attended the U.S. Naval Officer Candidate School at Newport, Rhode Island. Subsequently, Sangren was commissioned as a LTJG and served in the Underwater Demolition Team Eleven from 1969 to 1972. In 1972, Sangren headed for Stanford University to pursue his Ph.D in anthropology under the supervision of G. William Skinner. He conducted fieldwork on the Mazu's cult in Taiwan between 1974 and 1977.[2] Sangren received his Ph.D. in January 1980.[3] Academic career[edit] After completing his Ph.D. in 1980, Sangren became an assistant professor of anthropology at Cornell University. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1986 and to Professor in 1992. Sangren was the associate director of Cornell's East Asia Program between 1988 and 1989, and chair of Cornell's Anthropology department between 1997-2000.[3] Research[edit] Sangren's research combines insights drawn from structuralist theory with practice-oriented critiques to illuminate Chinese ritual processes and cosmological symbols. His first book History and Magical Power in a Chinese Community (1987), argues that notions of magical power (ling ?) attributed to supernatural entities embody an implicit ideology of social production and an explicit modality of local historical experience. His second book Chinese Sociologics (2000) extends this earlier work's primarily Marxian and Durkheimian focus on collective institutions and representations to accommodate individual agency and desire - particularly in the arena of Chinese family and gender. The book argues that symbolic alienation – representations that invert the relations between producers and products - plays an important role in constituting a culturally particular "mode of production of desire." Sangren's current project, tentatively entitled Filial Obsessions, is a broadly framed analysis on the cult of Nezha and critique of Chinese patriliny, mythic narrative, and gender ideology informed by a synthesis of Marxian and psychoanalytic perspectives.[4] Selected publications[edit] Books and monographs[edit] 2000 Chinese Sociologics: An Anthropological Account of the Role of Alienation in Social Reproduction.

Compulsory Basic Training
In the United Kingdom, the term Compulsory Basic Training (abbreviated to CBT) is a preliminary vehicular training course which must be completed by people wishing to ride a motorcycle or moped unaccompanied on the road,[1] and remains valid for 2 years upon completion.[2] It was introduced in Great Britain on 1 December 1990 as a means of reducing accidents on the road caused by inexperienced drivers by reviewing aspects of riding both on and off the road with a qualified motorcycle instructor registered with an Approved Training Body (ATB).[3] If a full car licence was obtained before 1 February 2001 it is not necessary to complete a CBT course to ride a moped.[4]
Students engaged in off-road training. In this stage of the CBT, the learner is acclimatised with bicycle manoeuvres and awareness before progressing to on-road training.

Element B - Learning the controls of the motorcycle. Element C - Off-road riding. Element D - Road briefing and safety talk. Element E - Practical on-road riding. Northern Ireland introduced CBT in 2011. As of 21 February 2011 learner riders in Northern Ireland must complete CBT before being allowed on the road unaccompanied. Those who obtained their provisional motorcycle/moped licence before the implementation of CBT in Northern Ireland had until 21 February 2012 to pass their motorbike test, or else take CBT to continue riding as a learner. Those who passed a car test prior to 21 February 2011 have their full moped entitlement preserved without having to take CBT.[7] Bibliography[edit] United Kingdom Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. 2006.

Mihailo Boj?i?

Mihailo Boj?i? (Kratovo, late 16th or early 17th century – Chilandar, 1669), metropolitan of Kratovo 1648-1660. The House of Boj?i? held the title of dukes of Kratovo and were associated with Dimitrije Pepi?, who owned the mines in the surrounding region. Contents 1 Family and Youth 2 Metropolitan of Kratovo 3 Refuge and Travels 4 Mihailo’s nationality 5 References Family and Youth[edit] Mihailo was born at the turn of the 17th century in the city of Kratovo. He came from a family of local dukes, Boj?i?s (alternative spelling: Boji?i?), rich merchants who controlled the famous mines. As the Ottoman authorities tightened control of Kratovo reducing its autonomy, his father, duke Nikola Boj?i?, decided to become a monk. After that he turned Mihailo, still a young man, to the custody of the Serbian Patriarch Pajsije I. Mihailo spent his youth in the Monastery of the Patriarchate of Pe? and was ordained as a archdeacon. He served at patriarch's residency for eleven years and, since Pajsije was a lover of books, he got a very good education.[1] Metropolitan of Kratovo[edit] In 1648 Pajsije's successor Gavrilo I ordained Mihailo as the metropolitan of his native Kratovo. During his service as Kratovo metropolitan Mihailo used also longer titles such as „metropolitan of Kolasija, Kratovo, Štip and Radomir“, „of Banja, Kratovo and Štip“, of Kolasija, called Banja, of Radomir, Sirištinca, Kratovo, Palanka, Štip and Radoviš, „of Kolasija and the Serb land of Kratovo“.[2] Refuge and Travels[edit] Due to the quarrels with the Turks Mihailo had to flee Kratovo already in 1649. Perhaps this happened for the same reason a few years later patriarch Gavrilo I had to flee for Russia: due to the War of Candia the Ottomans were very suspicious of any connections with the West, which the Serbian Patriarchs cherished, hoping for material help of the impoverished and highly taxed church. Mihailo left for the Serb monastery on Mount Athos, Chilandar, where he stayed for two years. He made Chilandar his new home and left a good impression with the brotherhood.[3] Despite his refuge, Mihailo continued to be the metropolitan of Kratovo. In 1651 he traveled to Russia to collect donations for Chilandar and the Monastery of the Patriarchate of Pe?.[4] While this was usual for monks, it was not so often that high church officials went to such missions. In that year we find Mihailo in Putivl, where from he wrote to church authorities asking them to allow him to stay in Russia. However, he stayed only until Easter of 1654 when he once again came to Mount Athos. In 1656 he went onto a pilgrimage visiting Jerusalem on Easter 1657. From there he traveled back to Russia via Egypt, Constantinople, Mount Athos, Moldavia, Wallachia and Poland. He stayed in Russia until 1660.[5] The last years of his life Mihailo spent in Chilandar where he lived in the hermit's cell of Saint Nicholas. His skull is still preserved in a box in this very cell. Mihailo’s nationality[edit] In 1651 Mihailo wrote to the Russian Emperor "My forefathers and ancestors are dukes of the Serbian land of Kratovo" (Roditelji i praroditelji moji su srpske zemlje grada Kratova kneževi).[6] Next year, in the documents of Russian Imperial House, it is recorded that "Serb Metropolitan Mihailo" (serbskii mitropolit Mihailo) had dinner with the Russian Emperor.[7] In 1653 hieromonk Damaskin wrote a letter to his spiritual father metropolitan Mihailo in which there is a statement about mercy of the Russian Emperor towards "our Serbian language" (jeziku nashemu Srbskom).[8] References[edit] ^ ??. ?. ????????????, ???????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ?

Karma in Hinduism
Karma is a concept in Hinduism which explains causality through a system where beneficial effects are derived from past beneficial actions and harmful effects from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions throughout a Atman's reincarnated lives[1] forming a cycle of rebirth. The causality is said to be applicable not only to the material world but also to our thoughts, words, actions and actions that others do under our instructions.[2][importance?]

The term karman also appears significantly in the Atharva Veda. According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, "a man is born to the world he has made" and one is placed in a balance in the other world for an estimate of one's good and evil deed. It also declares that as a man is 'constituted' by his desires, he is born in the other world with reference to these.[3] Scholars have generally agreed that the earliest formulation of the Karma doctrine occurs in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, which is the earliest of the Upanisads. The doctrine occurs here in the context of a discussion of the fate of the individual after death.[4] The doctrine of transmigration of the soul, with respect to fateful retribution for acts committed, does not appear in the Rig Veda.[5] The belief in rebirth is, suggests Radhakrishnan, evident in the Brahmanas, where words like punar-mrtyu(re-death), punar-asu (coming to life again) and punarajati (rebirth) are used to denote it.[6] Radhakrishnan acknowledges that other scholars interpret certain punar-mrtyu verses of Rigveda to be discussing "repeated deaths"; however, he suggests that it might also be re-interpreted to imply rebirth, as in "come home once again".[6] The concept of karma first appears strongly in the Bhagavad Gita.[7][unreliable source?] The topic of karma is mentioned in the Puranas.[8] Definitions[edit] "Karma" literally means "deed" or "act", and more broadly names the universal principle of cause and effect, action and reaction, which Hindus believe governs all consciousness.[9] Karma is not fate, for we act with what can be described as a conditioned free will creating our own destinies. Karma refers to the totality of our actions and their concomitant reactions in this and previous lives, all of which determine our future. The conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and dispassionate reaction. Not all karmas rebound immediately. Some accumulate and return unexpectedly in this or other lifetimes. Human beings are said to produce karma in four ways:[10][better source needed] through thoughts through right attitude words through actions that we perform ourselves through actions others perform under our instructions Everything that we have ever thought, spoken, done or caused is karma, as is also that which we think, speak or do this very moment.[2] Hindu scriptures divide karma into three kinds:[2] Sanchita is the accumulated karma. It would be impossible to experience and endure all karmas in one lifetime. From this stock of sanchita karma, a handful is taken out to serve one lifetime and this handful of actions, which have begun to bear fruit and which will be exhausted only on their fruit being enjoyed and not otherwise, is known as prarabdha karma. Prarabdha Fruit-bearing karma is the portion of accumulated karma that has "ripened" and appears as a particular problem in the present life. Kriyamana is everything that we produce in the current life. All kriyamana karmas flow in to sanchita karma and consequently shape our future. Only in human life we can change our future destiny. After death we lose Kriya Shakti (ability to act) and do (kriyamana) karma until we are born again in another human body. Some believe that only human beings who can distinguish right from wrong can do (kriyamana) karma.[10] Therefore, animals and young children are considered incapable of creating new karma (and thus cannot affect their future destinies) as they are incapable of discriminating between right and wrong.[11] Tulsidas, a Hindu saint, said: "Our destiny was shaped long before the body came into being." As long as the stock of sanchita karma lasts, a part of it continues to be taken out as prarabdha karma for being enjoyed in one lifetime, leading to the cycle of birth and death. A Jiva cannot attain moksha (liberation) from the cycle of birth and death, until the accumulated sanchita karmas are completely exhausted.[12][unreliable source?] Unkindness yields spoiled fruits, called paap, and good deeds bring forth sweet fruits, called punya. As one acts, so does one become: one becomes virtuous by virtuous action, and evil by evil action.[13] The role of divine forces[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(October 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Several different views exist in Hinduism, some extant today and some historical, regarding the role of divine beings in controlling the effects of karma or the lack thereof. Vedanta view[edit] In the theistic side of Vedanta,the creator Ishvara rules over the world through the law of karma.[14] Sankara (Advaita)[edit] In non-dualistic (Advaita) school of Vedanta, the creator is not the ultimate reality, "I am God" is the supreme truth, the pursuit of self-knowledge is spirituality, and it shares the general concepts of karma-rebirth-samsara ideas found in Buddhism with some important differences.[15] In a commentary to Brahma Sutras (III, 2, 38, and 41), a Vedantic text, Adi Sankara, an Indian philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, a sub-school of Vedanta, argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities like adrsta—an unseen force being the metaphysical link between work and its result—by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him, then, must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being (Ishvara).[16] A human's karmic acts result in merits and demerits. Since unconscious things generally do not move except when caused by an agent (for example, the ax moves only when swung by an agent), and since the law of karma is an unintelligent and unconscious law, Sankara argues there must be a conscious God who knows the merits and demerits which persons have earned by their actions, and who functions as an instrumental cause in helping individuals reap their appropriate fruits.[17] Thus, God affects the person's environment, even to its atoms, and for those souls who reincarnate, produces the appropriate rebirth body, all in order that the person might have the karmically appropriate experiences.[18] Thus, there must be a theistic administrator or supervisor for karma, i.e., God. Advaita according to Sivananda This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) Swami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as God. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.[19] There is a passage from Swami Sivananda's translation of the Svetasvatara Upanishad (4:6) illustrating this concept: Two birds of beautiful plumage — inseparable friends — live on the same tree. Of these two one eats the sweet fruit while the other looks on without eating. In his commentary, the first bird represents the individual soul, while the second represents Brahman or God. The soul is essentially a reflection of Brahman. The tree represents the body. The soul identifies itself with the body, reaps the fruits of its actions, and undergoes rebirth. The Lord alone stands as an eternal witness, ever contented, and does not eat, for he is the director of both the eater and the eaten. Swami Sivananda also notes that God is free from charges of partiality and cruelty which are brought against him because of social inequality, fate, and universal suffering in the world. According to the Brahma Sutras, individual souls are responsible for their own fate; God is merely the dispenser and witness with reference to the merit and demerit of souls. In his commentary on Chapter 2 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda further notes that the position of God with respect to karma can be explained through the analogy of rain. Although rain can be said to bring about the growth of rice, barley and other plants, the differences in various species is due to the diverse potentialities lying hidden in the respective seeds. Thus, Sivananda explains that differences between classes of beings are due to different merits belonging to individual souls. He concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.[20] Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)[edit] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) Ramanuja of the Vishishtadvaita school, another sub-school of Vedanta, addresses the problem of evil by attributing all evil things in life to the accumulation of evil karma of jivas (souls in bondage to a corporeal form) and maintains that God is "amala," or without any stain of evil.[21] In Sri Bhasya, Ramanuja's interpretation of the Brahma sutras from a Vaishnavite theistic view, Brahman, whom he conceives as Vishnu, arranges the diversity of creation in accordance with the different karma of individual souls.[22][unreliable source?] Ramanuja, reiterates that inequality and diversity in the world are due to the fruits of karma of different souls and the omnipresent energy of the soul suffers pain or pleasure due to its karma.[23] Unlike the Semitic religions, e.g., Abrahamic religions, which believe that God created the soul and the world out of ‘nothing,’ Ramanuja believed that creation is an eternally recurring cyclic process and hence God is free from the responsibility of starting it and causing the evils accruing from it.[23] Instead he believed that karma, the result of the actions of Jivas (souls) in previous embodiments, causes the good and evil, enjoyments and sufferings of karma which have to be necessarily to be enjoyed or suffered by the Jivas themselves who are responsible for the fruits.[23] Although souls alone have the freedom and responsibility for their acts and thus reap the fruits of karma, i.e., good and evil karma, God as Vishnu, is the supreme Enforcer of karma, by acting as the Sanctioner (Anumanta) and the Overseer (Upadrasta).[24] According to Ramanuja, all jivas are burdened with their load of Karma, which gives them only enjoyments and sufferings, but also desires and tendencies to act in particular ways; although the moral responsibility accrues only to the Jiva, as he acts according to the tendencies and deserts he has acquired by his karma, Ramanuja believes that God wills only their fructification.[24] According to the foregoing concept, God is "compared to light which may be used for forging or for reading scriptures," but the merits or demerit "devolves entirely on the persons concerned and not on the light."[24] Furthermore, Ramanuja believes that Vishnu wishing to do a favour to those who are resolved on acting so as fully to please Him, engenders in their minds a tendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as means to attain to Him; while on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on lines of action altogether displeasing to Him, He engenders in their minds a delight in such actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles in the way of the attainment of God.[25] Madhva (Dvaita)[edit] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) Madhva, the founder of the Dvaita school, another sub-school of Vedanta, on the other hand, believes that there must be a root cause for variations in karma even if karma is accepted as having no beginning and being the cause of the problem of evil.[26] Since jivas have different kinds of karma, from good to bad, all must not have started with same type of karma from the beginning of time. Thus, Madhva concludes that the jivas (souls) are not God's creation as in the Christian doctrine, but are rather entities co-existent with Vishnu, although under His absolute control. Souls are thus dependent on Him in their pristine nature and in all transformations that they may undergo.[26] According to Madhva, God, although He has control, does not interfere with Man's free will; although He is omnipotent, that does not mean that He engages in extraordinary feats. Rather, God enforces a rule of law and, in accordance with the just deserts of jivas, gives them freedom to follow their own nature.[27] Thus, God functions as the sanctioner or as the divine accountant, and accordingly jivas are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated karma, good and bad. Since God acts as the sanctioner, the ultimate power for everything comes from God and the jiva only utilizes that power, according to his/her innate nature. However, like Shankara's interpretation of the Brahma Sutras as mentioned earlier, Madhva, agrees that the rewards and punishments bestowed by God are regulated by Him in accordance with the good and sinful deeds performed by them, and He does so of out of His own will to keep himself firm in justice and he cannot be controlled in His actions by karma of human beings nor can He be accused of partiality or cruelty to anyone.[27] Swami Tapasyananda further explains the Madhva view by illustrating the doctrine with this analogy: the power in a factory comes from the powerhouse (God), but the various cogs (jivas) move in a direction in which they are set. Thus he concludes that no charge of partiality and cruelty can be brought against God. The jiva is the actor and also the enjoyer of the fruits of his/her own actions.[26] Madhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs, owing to his concept of eternal damnation. For example, he divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation (Mukti-yogyas), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration (Nitya-samsarins), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal hell or Andhatamas (Tamo-yogyas).[28] Mimamsa view[edit] Earlier historical traditions of Hinduism such as Mimamsakas, reject any such notions of divinity being responsible and see karma as acting independently, considering the natural laws of causation sufficient to explain the effects of karma.[29][30][31] According to the Mimamsakas it is useless to set up a God for that purpose, since Karma itself can give the result at a future time.[32] Proof of existence of God from Karma[edit] In the later writings in the Nyaya, school of philosophy, Udayana's Nyayakusumanjali used Karma for the last of his nine proofs of the existence of a creative God:[33] See Nyaya on God and Salvation. Swami Sivananda Saraswati puts it like this: "Some people die when they are eighty years old; some die when they are in the womb; some die at twenty; some at forty. What is the cause for the variation? Who has fixed the span of life for all? This clearly proves that there is the theory of Karma, that there is one Omniscient Lord, who is the dispenser of the fruits of the actions of the Jivas, who fixes the span of life of the Jivas in accordance with their nature of Karma or actions, who knows the exact relation between Karmas and their fruits. As Karma is Jada or insentient, it certainly cannot dispense with the fruits of their actions."[34][better source needed] Views of the theistic Hindu traditions believing in a supreme God[edit] This section's tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia. See Wikipedia's guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Sivananda concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.[20] Shaivism[edit] Thirugnana Sambandar[edit] Karma as action philosophy and value theory: if we sow goodness, we will reap goodness. Sambandar of the Shaiva Siddhanta school, in the 7th century C.E., writes about karma in his outline of Shaivism. He explains the concept of karma in Hinduism by distinguishing it from that of Buddhism and Jainism, which do not require the existence of an external being like God. In their beliefs, just as a calf among a large number of cows can find its mother at suckling time, so also does karma find the specific individual it needs to attach to and come to fruition.[35] However, theistic Hindus posit that karma, unlike the calf, is an unintelligent entity.[35] Hence, karma cannot locate the appropriate person by itself. Sambantha concludes that an intelligent Supreme Being with perfect wisdom and power (Shiva, for example) is necessary to make karma attach to the appropriate individual.[35] In such sense, God is the Divine Accountant.[35] Appayya Dikshita[edit] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) Appayya Dikshita, a Shaiva theologian and proponent of Shiva Advaita, states that Shiva only awards happiness and misery in accordance with the law of karma.[36] Thus persons themselves perform good or evil actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Siva alone. Srikantha[edit] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) Srikantha, another Saivite theologian and proponent of Siva Advaita, believes that individual souls themselves do things which may be regarded as the cause of their particular actions, or desisting from particular actions, in accordance with the nature of the fruition of their past deeds.[37] Srikantha further believes that Siva only helps a person when he wishes to act in a particular way or to desist from a particular action. Regarding the view that karma produce their own effects directly, Srikantha holds that karma being without any intelligence cannot be expected to produce manifold effects through various births and various bodies; rather fruits of one's karma can be performed only by the will of God operating in consonance with man's free will, or as determined in later stages by man's own karma so the prints of all karma are distributed in the proper order by the grace of God Shiva.[37] In this way, God is ultimately responsible on one hand for our actions, and on the other for enjoyment and suffering in accordance with our karmas, without any prejudice to humans' moral responsibility as expressed through free will or as determined later by our own deeds.[37] A good summary of his view is that "man is responsible, free to act as he wills to, for Siva only fulfills needs according to the soul's karma." [38] Vaishnavism[edit] Sacred Texts[edit] Bhagavata Purana[edit] In Chapter 1 of 10th book of the Bhagavata Purana, Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, exhorts Kamsa to refrain from killing his wife, Devaki, the mother of Krishna, by stating that death is certain for those who are born and when the body returns to the five elements, the soul leaves the body and helplessly obtains another form in accordance with the laws of karma, citing passages from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, IV:4:3.[39] Moreover, he adds and states that the soul materializes into an appropriate body whatever the state of the mind one remembers at the time of death; i.e., at the time of the death, the soul and its subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego, is projected into the womb of a creature, human or non-human that can provide a gross body that is most suitable for the dominant state of the mind of the particular person at the time of death; note that this passage is similar in meaning as Bhagavad Gita, VIII, verse 6 [39] Edwin Bryant, Associate Professor of religion at Rutgers University, New Jersey provided the foregoing commentaries on the discussion of Vasudeva in the Bhagavata Purana. Vishnu Sahasranama[edit] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) Many names in the Vishnu Sahasranama, the thousand names of Vishnu allude to the power of God in controlling karma. For example, the 135th name of Vishnu, Dharmadhyaksha, in the Advaita philosopher Sankara's interpretation means, "One who directly sees the merits (Dharma) and demerits (Adharma), of beings by bestowing their due rewards on them." [40] Other names of Vishnu alluding to this nature of God are Bhavanah, the 32nd name, Vidhata, the 44th name, Apramattah, the 325th name, Sthanadah, the 387th name and Srivibhavanah, the 609th name.[41] Bhavanah, according to Sankara's interpretation, means "One who generates the fruits of Karmas of all Jivas (souls) for them to enjoy."[42] The Brahma Sutra (3.2.28) "Phalmatah upapatteh" speaks of the Lord's function as the bestower of the fruits of all actions of the jivas.[42] Vaishnavite Vedanta schools of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Madhva's Dvaita[edit] See above discussion of karma under the Vedanta sections of Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita) and Madhva (Dvaita) for treatment of karma under the two Vaishnavite teachers. Gaudiya Vaishnavism view[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) "According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Krishna. By the mercy of both Krsna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service."[43] Other Vaishnavite thoughts[edit] Kulashekhara Alwar, a Vaishnava devotee, says in his "Mukundamala Stotra": 'yad yad bhavyam bhavatu bhagavan purva-karma-anurupam'. And purva-karma or bhaagya or daiva is unseen adrsta by us, and is known only to God as Vidhaataa.[44] God created the law of karma, and God will not violate it. God does, however, give courage and strength if asked. Nyaya[edit] The Nyaya school, one of six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, states that one of the proofs of the existence of God is karma;[45] It is seen that some people in this world are happy, some are in misery. Some are rich and some poor. The Naiyanikas explain this by the concept of karma and reincarnation. The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of the individual who is the agent; there ought to be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God.[45] This belief of Nyaya, accordingly, is the same as that of Vedanta.[45] Dharma??stras[edit] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) In Hinduism, more particularly the Dharma??stras, Karma is a principle in which "cause and effect are as inseparably linked in the moral sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad action leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past deeds".[46] Thus it is important to understand that karma does not go away, one must either reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of his past actions. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states, "According as a man acts and according as he believes so will he be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful. He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that person consists of desires. An as is his desire so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does that he will reap".[47] The doctrine of karma dates from ancient times and besides the above author is mentioned in the Gautama dharma-sutra, Shatapatha Brahmana, Kathaaka-grhya-sutra, Chandogya Upanishad, Markandeya Purana and many others.[48] The shastras written about karma go into some detail about possible consequences of karma. There is often talk about coming back as a variety of different object when it comes to reincarnation and pasts lives. In this case, it holds true, or at least insofar as the texts state. The Kathaaka-grhya-sutra states, "some human beings enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence; others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) according to their deeds and according to their knowledge".[49][not in citation given] More extensively discussed is the consequences of karma in relation to sin. "Karmavipaka means the ripening (or fruition) of evil actions or sins. This fruition takes three forms, as stated in the Yogasutra II. 3, i.e., jati (birth as a worm or animal), ayuh (life i.e. living for a short period such as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell".[50] Mitigation of bad karma[edit] According to a theistic view, the effects of one's bad karma may be mitigated. Examples of how bad karma can be mitigated include following, or living virtuously; performing good deeds, such as helping others; yoga, or worshiping God in order to receive grace; and conducting pilgrimages to sacred places, such as or to get grace of God.Editors of Hinduism Today Magazine, What is Hinduism? [51] In another example, Ganesha can unweave his devotees from their karma, simplifying and purifying their lives, but this only happens after they have established a personal relationship with Him.[52] Examples of getting God's grace are further illustrated below. Upanishads[edit] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) Shvetashvatara Upanishad 7 and 12 aver that the doer of the deeds wanders about and obtains rebirth according to his deeds but postulates an omnipotent creater, i.e., Isvara and the doctrine of grace.[53] Isvara is the great refuge of all and a person attains immortality when blessed by Isvara or at Isvara's pleasure.[54] A person can be free from sorrow through the grace of Isvara. Therefore, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad postulates a supreme Being whose grace to devotees provides a way of escape from the law of karma. As Adi Sankara stated in his commentary on Shvetashvatara Upanishad VI:4, "If we dedicate all our works to Ishvara, we will not be subject to the law of karma." [53] Relation between birth in a particular body to karma[edit] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) See also: Reincarnation Theistic schools believe in cycles of creations where souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of God alone. For example, Kaushitaki Upanishad 1.2 asserts that birth in different forms of existence as a worm, insect, fish, bird, lion, boar, snake or a human, is determined by a person's deeds and knowledge.[55] Chandogya Upanishad 5.10.7 distinguishes between good birth such as birth in a spiritual family, i.e., (brahmin caste) or an evil birth, such as birth as a dog or hog.) Thus, the doctrine of karma comes to explain why different life forms manifest, into widely various levels of biological development such as characterization into different species from plants to various types of animals, and to even differences between members of the same species, such as humans.[56] Swami Nikilananda comments: As the rivers, following their different courses, ultimately merge in the ocean and give up their names and forms, so the devotees, losing their names and forms, become one with the Supreme Reality.[57] Relation between astrology and karma[edit] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (January 2015) Charles Keyes, professor emeritus at the University of Washington and E. Valentine Daniel, professor of anthropology at Columbia University state that many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the "fruit of karma." [58] The Navagraha, planetary deities, including Shani (Saturn), are considered subordinate to Ishvara (i.e., the Supreme Being) and are believed by many to assist in the administration of justice.[58] Thus, these planets can influence earthly life.[58] Such planetary influences are believed by many to be measurable using astrological methods including Jyoti?a, the Hindu system of astrology.[59] Other uses in Hinduism[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Besides narrow meaning of karma as the reaction or suffering being due to karma of their past lives and that one would have to transmigrate to another body in their next life, it is often used in the broader sense as action or reaction. Thus, karma in Hinduism may mean an activity, an action or a materialistic activity. Often with the specific combination it takes specific meanings, such as karma-yoga or karma-kanda means "yoga or actions" and "path of materialistic activity" respectively. Yet another example is Nitya karma, which describes rituals which have to be performed daily by Hindus, such as the Sandhyavandanam which involves chanting of the Gayatri Mantra. Other uses include such expressions such as "ugra-karma", meaning bitter, unwholesome labor.[60] It has also been argued that Karma has a role in Hindu society as a whole. When one abides by their caste duty good Karma is earned and vice versa; and the Karma one collects is reflected in the next life as movement within the Caste system. The promise of upward mobility appealed to people, and was made plausible through Karma. This effectively "tamed" the lower castes into passive acceptance of the status quo. Thus, the Karma doctrine discouraged actual social mobility.[61] See also[edit] Hinduism portal Hindu answers to the problem of evil Problem of evil Reincarnation and Hinduism References[edit] ^ Brodd, Jefferey (2003).

Bill Tyson is a multi-award winning Irish writer and producer. Contents 1 Financial journalism 2 TV and film production 3 Books 4 Other work 5 References Financial journalism[edit] Tyson won three ESB national media awards for business journalism. Two of these (in 2000 and 2002) were for campaigning investigative journalism into the Irish Nationwide Building Society. In 2004, he won another ESB media award for stories on borrowers who were lured into unaffordable debts and subjected to aggressive repossession tactics. In 2006, Tyson become personal finance correspondent for the Sunday Tribune. Highlights included an exposé of an orgiastic lend-to-invest spree at ACC Bank, which was followed by the resignation of ACC's CEO three weeks later. For this story, Tyson received an "honourable mention" in the inaugural UCD Michael Smurfit Business Journalism Awards. In 2008 Tyson resigned from the Tribune over the immediate sacking of business editor Richard Delevan following a complaint from a leading advertiser about one of his articles (see -columnist resigns). From 2011 to 2013, Tyson was a financial reporter on the RTÉ TV series The Consumer Show. In the 2012 series Bill highlighted a Payment Protection Insurance mis-selling controversy, following which widespread repayments were made by banks to thousands of consumers. He also exposed high mortgage rates charged at the time by Permanent tsb. These rates were reduced shortly after the issue was aired on the show. Other stories dealt with the "Phoenix company" phenomenon, where consumers lost out when businesses went into liquidation. Tyson has also worked as a freelance journalist for the Sunday Times, Sunday Independent and The Business Show on RTÉ Radio 1. In the Sunday Times in 2012, Tyson showed exactly how much brokers mis-sell investment policies by "churning" the existing business of unsuspecting clients. Following this article, the Irish Insurance Federation called for an investigation and shortly after, the Central Bank instigated one. TV and film production[edit] In 2005 Tyson teamed up with Declan Cassidy to establish Timesnap, a film production company. In 2007, he earned a Masters degree in screenwriting from IADT. In July 2008, the Tyson-produced short film "Whatever Turns You On", directed by Cassidy, premiered at the Galway Film Fleadh and went on to win eight international awards including Best Short Short at Aspen Shortsfest USA 2009, an 'Oscar' qualifying event. In the same month it was short-listed for the award of Best Short Film at the Boston Irish Film Festival and received a theatrical release in Ireland and France. The short was also bought by TV stations in Poland, Ireland, Belgium, France and the UK. In 2008–2009 Tyson co-wrote and produced a four-hour television series for DCTV. The House (The House) 2009 also saw the release of the short film Veronique – penned and produced by Tyson – under the Irish Film Board's Virtual Cinema scheme. Veronique was acquired by NBC Asia and screened in several countries with a potential audience of billions. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn8Q8FyUTWM) The following year saw the release of two documentaries produced by Tyson for DCTV A Century of Sailing, on the oldest sailing boats in the world still racing (Howth 17s), and Little Jerusalem, a portrayal of a tiny Irish Jewish community, which has had an extraordinary impact. In 2011, the Tyson-produced documentary JJ and the Admiral was launched by Taoiseach Enda Kenny at the Royal Theatre Castlebar in front of an audience of over 1,000 people.(film-story-of-admiral-brown-and-jj-ohara) Books[edit] Tyson wrote and published an annual finance book – Your Money – which was a top ten non-fiction best-seller several times between 1996 and 2004. In 2006, a biography of Mayoman Admiral William Brown written by well-known Argentine author Marcos Aguinis and translated by Bill Tyson was published to critical acclaim. (Admiral-William-Brown) Other work[edit] Through a voluntary group of media professionals, Community Media Associates, Tyson is a member of Dublin Community Television (DCTV) and was involved in a project to teach video production skills to disadvantaged youth in Drogheda in 2010. The following year, Timesnap Ltd, where he is a director, became a fully fledged partner on two major EU training projects.

Marilyn Bergman was born in 1929, coincidentally at the same Brooklyn hospital where Alan had been born four years earlier, and studied music at The High School of Music & Art in New York before studying psychology and English at New York University.[2] Alan worked as a television director and songwriter at Philadelphia's WCAU-TV in the early 1950s. Johnny Mercer encouraged Alan to move to Los Angeles and become a professional songwriter.[3][4] Despite the geographical proximity of their upbringing in New York, the Bergmans did not meet until they had both moved to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. Marilyn had moved to California and was friends with songwriter Bob Russell and his wife, Anna, and later described "drif[ing] into songwriting really by accident because I had a fall and broke my shoulder and couldn't play piano so I started writing lyrics". Marilyn also felt that she lacked the discipline or talent required to become a concert pianist. The Bergmans had both become collaborators with composer Lew Spence, and only met when Spence suggested they all work together. The Bergmans married in 1958, and have a daughter, Julie Bergman Sender, who works as an independent film producer.[3][5] With Spence the Bergmans wrote the lyrics for the title tracks for Dean Martin's 1958 album Sleep Warm and Frank Sinatra's 1960 album Nice 'n' Easy.[6][7] In 1961 the Bergmans wrote their first title song for a motion picture, for The Right Approach, composed by Spence. In 1964 the Bergmans wrote lyrics to their first Broadway musical, Something More!, to music by Sammy Fain.[8] The Bergmans wrote lyrics for "In the Heat of the Night" with music by Quincy Jones for the 1967 film of the same name, which has been described as their "breakthrough".[9] The couple would later work with Jones on Michael Jackson's soundtrack album for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), for which they wrote the lyrics for "Someone In the Dark", and the 2007 Ennio Morricone tribute album We All Love Ennio Morricone for which they wrote lyrics to "I Knew I Loved You", which was sung by Celine Dion.[10] The Bergmans long relationship with the French composer Michel Legrand began in the late 1960s. The couple wrote English lyrics for Legrand's song "The Windmills of Your Mind" featured in the The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), which won them their first Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 41st Academy Awards in 1969. The Bergmans and Legrand were subsequently nominated for the Best Original Song award in the following two years for "What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?" from The Happy Ending (1969) and "Pieces of Dreams" from the 1970 film of the same name. The couple's minor work with Legrand in this period included "Listen to the Sea" from Ice Station Zebra (1968) and "Nobody Knows" and "Sweet Gingerbread Man" from The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart (1970).[11] Legrand would also feature eight of the Bergman's lyrics on his 1972 album with Sarah Vaughan.[12] In 1983 at the 55th Academy Awards, the Bergmans work on "How Do You Keep the Music Playing?" composed by Legrand for the film Best Friends would be nominated for the Best Original Song award. The 55th Academy Awards was also significant as the Bergmans became the first songwriters ever to have written three of the five nominations for the Academy Award for Best Song, being nominated for "It Might Be You" from Tootsie (composed by Dave Grusin), and "If We Were in Love" from Yes, Giorgio (composed by John Williams), in addition to "How Do You Keep the Music Playing?". At the subsequent Academy Awards, their work with Legrand on the 1983 film Yentl won them the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score or Adaptation Score, with the songs "Papa, Can You Hear Me?" and "The Way He Makes Me Feel" from the film also being nominated for the Best Original Song award. The Bergmans were also co-writers of "An American Reunion", the opening ceremony of the inaugural festivities at Washington D.C.'s Lincoln Memorial that marked Bill Clinton's first term as President of the United States in January 1993.[3] In the late 1990s the Bergmans received their most recent nominations for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, for "Moonlight" (composed by John Williams) for the 1995 film Sabrina, and "Love Is Where You Are" (music by Mark Isham) for the 1999 film At First Sight. 1999 was the same year that the Bergmans received their most recent Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for "A Time to Dream"" (music by Hamisch) for the AFI's AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies Special. The Kennedy Center commissioned the Bergmans to write a song cycle in 2001, they chose to collaborate with the composer Cy Coleman. The resulting work, Portraits in Jazz: A Gallery of Songs was performed on May 17, 2002.[5] The Bergmans wrote the lyrics to Billy Goldenberg's television musical Queen of the Stardust Ballroom which won the couple their third Primetime Emmy Award Outstanding Achievement in Special Musical Material, it was later the couples second Broadway show, Ballroom, which opened in 1978.[13] In 2007 Alan Bergman released his first album as a vocalist, Lyrically, Alan Bergman, featuring lyrics written by him and his wife and arranged by Alan Broadbent and Jeremy Lubbock.[14] Reviewing the album for Allmusic, John Bush praised Bergman's "excellent interpretive skills" and Christopher Loundon in the JazzTimes described Bergman's voice as a "...revelation, suggesting both the wise, elder Sinatra and the astutely mellow Fred Astaire, with a touch of the offbeat dreaminess of Chet Baker."[15] The Bergmans have had a long professional relationship with the singer and actress Barbra Streisand. In addition to their work on the films Yentl and The Way We Were, in which Streisand starred, the Bergmans wrote Streisand's "One Voice" concert which was released as a live album in 1987. Marilyn also served as the executive producer of the "One Voice" concert. The Bergmans' song "Ordinary Miracles" from Streisand's 1994 concert tour and HBO special won the couple their third Emmy Award, with the couple's script for the tour also being nominated for a CableACE Award. The Bergmans received their fifth Emmy nomination for the song "On the Way to Becoming Me" (music by Marvin Hamlisch) from the AFI tribute to Streisand.[2] The Bergmans have also served as board members of Streisand's charitable foundation.[16] Streisand's 2011 album What Matters Most was recorded in tribute to the Bergmans, and featured ten songs by the couple that she had not previously recorded.[17] Awards and honors[edit] The Bergmans have been the recipients of numerous academic honors and lifetime achievement awards. The couple were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1980 and subsequently received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Hall of Fame in 1997.[3] The Bergmans were awarded honorary doctorates by the Berklee College of Music in 1995, they also received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Songwriters that year. In 1996 the couple were the recipients of the inaugural Fiorello Lifetime Achievement Award from New York City's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School. The Bergmans were later inducted into the LaGuardia High School's Hall of Fame.[5][18] In 1986 Marilyn was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.[19] Marilyn was later appointed an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture in 1996.[20] In 1998 Marilyn received an Honorary doctorate from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, and in 2011 Alan was presented with a Distinguished Alumnus award from his alma mater, the University of North Carolina. The Bergmans were the recipients of the National Music Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002, Marilyn was also the recipient of the Creative Arts Award from the Kaufman Cultural Center that same year.[3] The Bergmans have held several executive positions in organizations connected with the arts. Marilyn served as the president and chairman of the board of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) for fifteen years, from 1994 to 2009. Bergman was elected president and chairman after having served five terms as the since 1984 as the first woman ever to serve on ASCAP's board of directors. Marilyn completed her term as president in April 2009 and has since continued to serve on the board of ASCAP.[2] Marilyn also served two terms as president of CISAC, The International Confederation of Performing Rights Societies. Alan has served on the boards of directors of The Johnny Mercer Foundation, The Artists' Rights Foundation and The Jazz Bakery.[2] The Bergmans have also served on the executive committee of the Music Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and have been board members of the National Academy of Songwriters.[3] Marilyn also served as the president of the National Recording Preservation Board.[21] Notable lyrics[edit] The Bergman's notable lyrics and compositions include: "Sleep Warm" (music by Lew Spence) for Dean Martin's 1958 album Sleep Warm "Yellow Bird" written for Norman Luboff's arrangement of the creole song "Choucoune" "Nice 'n' Easy" (music by Lew Spence) for Frank Sinatra's 1960 album Nice 'n' Easy "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" (music by Neil Diamond), originally written for the All That Glitters but unused, was expanded by Diamond and released on his 1977 album I'm Glad You're Here with Me Tonight.

Julien Le Roy
Julien Le Roy (1686-1759) was a major 18th-century Parisian clockmaker and watchmaker.
For the French architect and archaeologist, see Julien-David Le Roy. Julien Le Roy Julien Le Roy (1686-1759) was a major 18th-century Parisian clockmaker and watchmaker. He was born in Tours in 1686, and by the age of 13, had already made his first clock. In 1699, he moved to Paris for further training. He became maître horloger in 1713 and later juré of his guild. Further appointments followed, including the Directorship of the Société des Arts, but the pinnacle of his achievement was being appointed clockmaker (Horloger Ordinaire du Roi) to King Louis XV in 1739. He carried on his business from premises in the Rue du Harlay until his death in 1759. His son Pierre Le Roy (1717–1785), a brilliant clock-maker in his own right, carried on the business until the early 1780s. Another son, Julien-David Le Roy (1724–1803), was a neo-classical architect and archaeologist, author of the Ruins of the Most Beautiful Monuments of Greece. His third son, Charles was a physician and Encyclopédiste, and his fourth, Jean-Baptiste Le Roy, a physicist and Enclyclopédiste as well. Examples of his work can be found in many major museums around the world, including the Louvre in Paris, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Police officer
A police officer, also known as a policeman, police agent[1][2] or by slang terms, is a warranted law employee of a police force. In the United States, "officer" usually is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, "officer" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often "constable". In some nations the use of the rank "officer" is legally reserved for military personnel. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary citizens.[3]

In The Federalist Papers (#51), James Madison wrote "If men were angels, no government would be necessary." These words apply to those who serve government, including police. The more general term for the function is law enforcement officer or peace officer. A sheriff is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a shire.[5] A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy. A common nickname for a police officer is COP or Constable on Patrol; the common rank of an officer within the police who practices criminal law enforcement. The term copper is originally used in Britain to mean "someone who captures". (In British English the term Cop is recorded (Shorter Oxford Dictionary) in the sense of 'To Capture' from 1704, derived from the Latin 'Capere' via the Old French 'Caper'.)[6] The common myth is that it's a term referring to the police officer's buttons which are made of copper. The word Cop derives from a Gaelic word which has the equivalence of saying, protector, leader, or chief. The terms are almost nearly homophonic but have similar meanings.[citation needed] The term County Mountie is used specifically in reference to county police officers or county sheriff's deputies in the United States. As with Canadian Mounties, the term mountie comes from police who serve while mounted on horseback (see cavalry). It was reported that when the 110th chemical element was being named, the name politzium was considered because 110 is the emergency telephone number for the police in Germany, where the element was first synthesized.[7] Duties and functions[edit] A group of Garda officers in the Republic of Ireland A British police officer on a police motorbike Responsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, rules and procedures dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.[8] In the majority of Western legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to discourage crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine community policing. Police are often used as an emergency service and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, disasters, search and rescue situations, and road traffic collisions. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with fire and emergency medical services. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of fire police). In many countries, there is a common emergency service number that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The Gold Silver Bronze command structure is a system set up to improve communications between ground based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room. Police are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing citations which typically may result in the imposition of fines, particularly for violations of traffic law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on motorcycles—called motor officers, these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply motors. Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic first aid such as CPR. In addition, some park rangers are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within national parks and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas Military police perform law enforcement functions within the military. Entry and promotion qualifications[edit] In most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.[citation needed] Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess tertiary education[citation needed] and in response to this many police forces have developed a "fast-track" scheme whereby those with university degrees spend two to three years as a Constable before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as Sergeants or Inspectors. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.)[citation needed] Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States state laws may codify statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. Officers of the Polizia Municipale from Piacenza, Italy Promotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in salary, it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded. Dependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may also apply for specialist positions, such as detective, police dog handler, mounted police officer, motorcycle officer, water police officer, or firearms officer (in countries where police are not routinely armed). In some countries such as in Singapore, police ranks may also be supplemented through conscription, similar to national service in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. In Singapore, for example, conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but are less stringent with minimum academic qualification requirements. Some police officers join as volunteers, who again may do so via differing qualification requirements. Pay[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2010) In some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.[9] In the United States, a police officer's salary averaged $52,810 in 2008.[10] In the United Kingdom for the year 2011–12 a police officer's average salary was £40,402.[11] Occupational hazards[edit] Line of duty deaths[edit] Memorial to a fallen police officer at the Texas Department of Public Safety Houston Webster Office in Houston[12] Line of duty deaths are deaths which occur while an officer is conducting his or her appointed duties. Despite the increased risk of being a victim of a homicide, automobile accidents are the most common cause of officer deaths. Officers are more likely to be involved in traffic accidents because of their large amount of time spent conducting vehicle patrols, or directing traffic, as well as their work outside their vehicles alongside or on the roadway, or in dangerous pursuits. Officers killed by suspects make up a smaller proportion of deaths. In the U.S. in 2005, 156 line of duty deaths were recorded of which 44% were from assaults on officers, 35% vehicle related (only 3% during vehicular pursuits) and the rest from other causes: heart attacks during arrests/foot pursuits, falling from heights during foot chases, diseases contracted either from suspects' body fluids or, more rarely, from window period emergency blood transfusions received after motor vehicle accidents, shootings, stabbings, accidental gun discharges or falls that result in blood loss.[13][3] Police officers who die in the line of duty, especially those who die from the actions of suspects or in accidents or heart attacks, are often given elaborate funerals, attended by large numbers of fellow officers. Their families may also be entitled to special pensions. Fallen officers are often remembered in public memorials, such as the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in the U.S., the National Police Memorial in the U.K. and the Scottish Police Memorial, at the Scottish Police College. In the United Kingdom, in the 10 years from April 2000 there were 143 line of duty deaths: 54 in road accidents travelling to or from duty, 46 in road accidents on duty, 23 from natural causes on duty, 15 from criminal acts, and 5 in other accidents.[14] In Great Britain, police do not normally carry firearms. Officers in Northern Ireland are routinely armed. The Singapore Police Force registered just over 100 deaths in a century up to the year 2000. There have been 28 New Zealand police officers killed by criminal act since 1890.[15] Work stress[edit] Indicators[edit] Standard police uniform in a majority of U.S. States during the 1930s The actual presence of stress in police work is well documented and evidenced by certain statistics. Researchers typically use suicide, divorce and alcoholism rates as three key indexes of stress in a group of people.[16] These factors paint a compelling picture of police officers demonstrating signs of significant stress, for example: A study in the United States, by National Surveillance of Police Suicide Study (NSOPS), showed 141 suicides in 2008 and 143 in 2009. This yields a suicide rate of 17/100,000, a figure that holds up under scrutiny and is consistent with CDC/NOMS data.[17] The overall suicide rate in the United States was 11.3 suicide deaths per 100,000 people.[18] There is some speculation or controversy that this official rate may understate the actual rate as it is often other police officers that report facts that lead to a cause of death determination, and death benefits, institutional image, and other factors may be incentives to misreport incident facts. It is speculated that some suicides are reported by fellow officers as accidents or as deaths in the line of duty perpetrated by unknown assailants. Also, many jurisdictions simply don't keep suicide statistics. Even though the information is incomplete, the available statistics suggest that police officers are more likely to commit suicide than the general population. However, there is still controversy in the interpretation of these statistics. When comparisons are made within age, gender, and racial cohorts, the differences are much less dramatic.[19][20] Although suicides may be notably more prevalent among police, it is not clear whether police suicides are the result of work stress or the consequence of other variables, such as the influence of a subculture of violence[21] Police officers are not more likely to experience interpersonal relationship problems. In a 2009 study, the divorce rates of law enforcement personnel were compared with the rates for other occupations, where data was analyzed from the 2000 U.S. Census. The results of the analysis indicate that the divorce rate for law enforcement personnel is lower than that of the general population, even after controlling for demographic and other job-related variables.[22] The propensity to domestic violence is also thought to be higher for police officers than the general population, though the statistics are very fuzzy and controversial. Police officers also seem to have relationship problems at work, typically with superiors or with political oversight, though the evidence is largely anecdotal and controversial. Alcoholism is considered another aberrant statistic for police officers. Although the statistics are fuzzy, clinically treated alcohol addiction rates are usually calculated to be about twice as high for police officers than for the general population in the United States. In contrast, statistics documenting alcohol abuse are less precise. Rates for arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol, or DUI or DWI, are somewhat higher for police officers than for other drivers, but the statistics are not widely trusted outside of the insurance industry since it is other police officers that make DUI arrests. Some departments and even some individual officers tend to hold police officers to a higher behavioral and ethical standard while others will recognize a 'blue line' behind which those within the 'brotherhood' are not held to the same standards as the rest of society. Despite the controversies in the interpretation of the statistics, it is generally considered evident that police officers are more susceptible to alcohol abuse than other occupations. The same conclusions are usually made regarding the police abuse of other substances, though the statistics are even less accurate, and even though the higher rates of substance abuse may be due in part to the more ready access to drugs and the more permissive atmosphere 'behind the blue line' rather than to occupational stresses. Hans Selye, the foremost researcher in stress in the world[citation needed], said that police work is "the most stressful occupation in America even surpassing the formidable stresses of air traffic control."[16] Other researchers, though, claim that police officers are more psychologically healthy than the general population. Police officers are increasingly more educated, more likely to engage in a regular program of exercise and to consume less alcohol and tobacco, and increasingly family-oriented. Healthy behavior patterns typically observed at entry training usually continue throughout the career of an officer. Even though the presence of occupation related stress seems to be well documented, it is highly controversial. Many within the law enforcement industry claim the propagation of incorrect suicide, divorce, and substance abuse statistics comes from people or organizations with political or social agendas, and that the presence of these beliefs within the industry makes it hard for health workers to help police officers in need of treatment to deal with the fear of negative consequences from police work which is necessary to enable police officers to develop a healthy expectancy of success in treatment.[23] In August 2014, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed that 8 out of every 10 law enforcement officers are overweight. This sparked some Police Departments to improve their officers' overall fitness. Assistant Chief Jeff Bryan of Garland, Texas stated, "I think it's important for all of us to keep the weight down and stay in shape-especially this job. The stress that we incur at this job... this is a great way to relieve stress and to keep the blood pressure down."[24] Indonesian policemen are required to participate in an exercise program because. In 2009, Mexican police also "set up a nutrition education program." In 2011, Russia's interior ministry warned its police officers, "lose weight or lose your job." Sources[edit] Polish police (riot control squad) Even though the presence of occupational stresses appear to be well documented, though not without controversy, the causes of workplace stress are comparatively unclear or even a matter of conjecture. Although individual policemen and institutional public relations typically cite the risks of being killed in the line of duty as the predominant source of stress for individual policemen, there is significant controversy regarding the causes of personal workplace stress due to the fact that the actual risk of being killed is so small relative to other occupations. It is charged that the myth of the high risks of occupational mortality connected with police work is often propagated by the law enforcement community as part of its institutional advancement and a central element in its public relations. Actual homicides of police are comparatively rare, but the reports of such incidents are typically reported in the press along with quotes by police officials or police officer family members stressing the notion that police officers 'put their lives on the line for the public' or 'risk their lives everyday', making it look like individual policemen routinely place themselves in mortal danger for low pay and little recognition, and that the view of police work as 'combat' is the source of police occupational stress indications. Another explanation often advanced is the idea that police officers will undergo some traumatic experience in their police work that they never recover from, leading to suicide, divorce, etc. However, since the effects of such traumatic stresses is readily recognized, there are usually proactive programs in place to help individual police officers deal with the psychological effects of a traumatic event. Unfortunately, there is some evidence that such programs are actually ineffective, especially group therapies, may re-traumatize the participant, weaken coping mechanisms, and contribute to the development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[25][26][27] Observations where police officers and other emergency workers, such as firemen, experience the same traumatic event, it is more likely that the police officer will have difficulty dealing with the long term emotional effects of the traumatic event. On this observation, some of the academic literature suggests that along these lines the causes of occupational stress is more complex for police officers. Stress in police work is often present in other occupations, but not in an ongoing capacity. One line of thinking is that the individual stresses of police work produce a condition of chronic stress. Police officers encounter stressors in call after call which sap their emotional strength. Debilitation from this daily stress accumulates making officers more vulnerable to traumatic incidents and normal pressures of life. The weakening process is often too slow to see; neither a person nor his friends are aware of the damage being done. The effects of chronic stresses is two-fold: First, prolonged stress causes people to regress. Their psychological growth reverses, and they become more immature. They rapidly become more childish and primitive, much like a person being sick for several days becoming more irritable and childish in its demands on other people. Second, chronic stress numbs people's sensitivity. They can't stand to continually see human misery. They must stop feeling or they won't survive. The mind has this defense mechanism so people can continue working in horrible situations. If they kept their normal sensitivity, they would fall apart. As they become insensitive to their own suffering, they become insensitive to the suffering of others. When treated with indignity, they lose not only a sense of their own dignity but also the dignity of others. The pain of others stops bothering them, and they are no longer bothered when they hurt others. The daily work of a police officer involves certain paradoxes and conflicts which may be difficult to deal with, the predominant examples are[16] Interaction with the public, whether socially or officially, such as in a traffic stop, involves a risk of physical harm. Being on guard for an attack and treating every interpersonal situation with affirmative commands makes the police officer appear brutal and detached, limits his actual effectiveness with the public and engenders chronic stress. US deputy sheriff with a Reising submachine gun A police department is a paramilitary organization. Policies, regulations, and procedures cover every facet of police work. Everything is expected to be done by the book with substantial repercussions, including civil and criminal liability, for varying from the expectations of operating procedures. Often the facts of a situation require a course of action that does not follow procedures. If he follows procedures exactly, he knows he won't fully help the public, and the public will think he is shirking his responsibility. If the officer follows his own judgment, he is taking a risk. The community and department expect officers to use judgment, but when they do, there is a danger they will be disciplined; another unnatural no-win situation engendering chronic stress.[citation needed] Police officers tend to become socially isolated. The reasons given for this isolation are lack of department support, a perceived sense of alienation from the residents of the community where they patrol, the degree of urbanism ("Big City"), and "anti-police" judicial verdicts. When a group of people are isolated they become disoriented and confused. Ironically an isolated class are usually the ones losing real world wisdom and tend to judge from a very limited perspective, leading to more stress.[28] A more anecdotal view looks at specific sources of stress in police work.[29] The sources of stress most often actually cited are: The fear of killing someone in the line of duty. Feeling at least partially responsible for getting your partner or somebody else killed in the line of duty. Lack of support by the department or superiors. The scheduling of work and irregular work demands resulting in a disruption of family time or family events or activities. Other more academic studies have produced similar lists, but may include items that the more anecdotal surveys do not reveal, such as 'exposure to neglected, battered, or dead children.'[30] Again, the actual fear of occupational death or physical harm is not high on the list of stress sources. There have been numerous academic studies on the specific sources of police stress, and most conclude organizational culture and workload as the key issues in officer stress.[31] Traumatic events are usually concluded to not be of sufficient scope or prevalence to account for prevalence of suicide, divorce, and substance abuse abnormalities. Abuse of power[edit] Individual cases[edit] Police sometimes act with force up to and including deadly force when they are brought into life-safety dangerous situations when dealing with criminals who attack them or resist arrest,[32] they must carry out this use of force to quickly de-escalate a situation which they were called into because of an individual who has recently committed a crime or is in the commission of a crime but refuses to comply with those that enforce the law. Often these criminals are repeat offenders.,[33] or in other circumstances.[34] Accountability[edit] Some publishers[who?] have recommended the usage of civilian measures in order to ensure police accountability for their actions and to curb corruption in the justice department. Examples that have been suggested include suggestions that civilians should videotape police officers when they suspect the officers doing something inappropriate or if they suspect the officers might do so.[35] See also[edit] COPS Women in law enforcement Field Training Officer List of slang terms for police officers Military police Police brutality Peace officer Police procedural Police rank President Grover Cleveland—former Sheriff of Erie County, New York President Theodore Roosevelt—Deputy Sheriff in the Dakota Territory, and New York City Police Commissioner The Thin Blue Line The Thin Blue Line (emblem) References[edit] ^ "Police ranks and pay in England and Wales".

The Mourne Wall – built in the early 20th century – runs up the western and southern slopes of the mountain, joining a small stone tower at the summit. Also on the summit are the remains of two prehistoric burial cairns, one of which is the remains of the highest known passage tomb in Ireland. In Irish mythology the mountain was associated with, and named after, the mythical figures Boirche and Slángha. It was later associated with, and named after, Saint Donard, who was said to have made the summit his hermitage. Up until the 1830s, people would climb the mountain as part of a yearly pilgrimage, which may have originally been a Lughnasadh ritual. Royal Engineers camped on the summit for four months in 1826 as part of the Ordnance Survey's Principal Triangulation. Contents 1 Geography 2 History and folklore 3 See also 4 References 4.1 Bibliography 5 External links Geography[edit] Slieve Donard sits at the northeastern edge of the Mournes, overlooking Newcastle and Dundrum Bay. It has three subsidiary peaks on the seaward side – Millstone Mountain (460 m),[5] Thomas's Mountain and Crossone. Two glens separate Slieve Donard from the neighbouring mountains of Slieve Commedagh (to the northwest) and Chimney Rock Mountain (to the south).[2] Slieve Commedagh, at 767 m (2,516 ft), is the second-highest of the Mourne Mountains.[6] The mountain is an easy climb although the path is very eroded at places. In recent years a stone path has been made on the steepest parts of the mountain. The summit provides spectacular views of the coast and as far afield as Belfast, 30 miles north, and Dublin, 55 miles to the south. History and folklore[edit] On the summit are the remains of two prehistoric cairns. The Great Cairn measures 36.5 metres from north to south, 43m from east to west, and 1m high. It appears to have been a Neolithic passage tomb, dating to 3300–3000 BCE. It is the highest known passage tomb in Britain and Ireland.[7] The Lesser Cairn lies 210 metres to the northeast. It measures 18m from north to south, 16m from east to west, and 4.5m high. It appears to have been an Early Bronze Age multiple-cist cairn, dating to 2300–1950 BCE.[7] They appear to parallel the two cairns on Slieve Gullion, which can be seen from Slieve Donard.[8] Both the cairns have been badly damaged and altered over time.[7] One of the summit cairns in 2009 Irish mythology identifies the Great Cairn as being the tomb or abode of mythical figures, and an entrance to the Otherworld.[9] The earliest sources give two names for the mountain: Benn mBoirchi (modern spelling: Beann Boirche) and Sliab Slánga (modern spelling: Sliabh Slángha).[9][10] Beann Boirche means "Boirche's peak", referring to a mythical cowherd and king who had seemingly supernatural powers. The plural name Beanna Boirche ("Boirche's peaks") was given to the Mourne Mountains. In Cath Maige Tuired ("the Battle of Moytura"), "Bennai Boirche" is called one of the "twelve chief mountains" of Ireland.[11] The name Sliabh Slángha means "Slángha's mountain". This refers to the mythical Slángha, son of Partholón, who was said to be the first physician in Ireland. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, he died in Anno Mundi 2533 (2533 years after "the creation of the world") and was buried in the passage tomb.[9] Ireland was Christianized from the 5th to 8th centuries. A local Christian missionary, Saint Donard (known in Irish as Domhanghairt or Domhanghart),[12][13][14] became associated with the mountain. According to tradition, he was a follower of Saint Patrick and founded a monastery at Maghera, a few miles north of the mountain. Donard seems to have made the Great Cairn into a hermit's cell and used the Lesser Cairn as an oratory.[15] In doing so, he "appropriated the mountain and the monument for Christianity".[16] According to the Life of Saint Patrick and the Tripartite Life of Saint Patrick, Patrick blessed Donard in the womb, declaring that Donard would not die but abide inside the mountain as a perpetual guardian.[17] According to folklore, a cave runs from the seashore to the cairn on the summit, and it is here that Donard (or Boirche) lives.[18] The writings of Gerald de Barri indicate that in the late 12th century the name Sliabh Slángha was going out of use and being replaced by Sliabh Domhanghairt.[19] Sliabh Dónairt is the modernised spelling. The Mourne Wall and the stone tower at the summit Up until the 1830s,[20] people made a pilgrimage to the mountaintop in late July each year. It is likely that this was originally a Lughnasadh ritual that became Christianized.[21] The church at Maghera and St Mary's Church at Ballaghanery Upper may have been starting points for the pilgrimage.[22] In 1826, as part of the Principal Triangulation, Royal Engineers used Slieve Donard as a base to map Ireland. They camped on the mountaintop from late July until late November that year and used the two cairns to make triangulation points.[23] During the Survey, two men died in a snowstorm on their way down the mountain and others were hurt during storms on the summit.[24] The Mourne Wall was built in the early 20th century and passes over fifteen mountains, including Slieve Donard. The wall goes up the western slope to a stone tower and then down the southern slope. It took 18 years to build, from 1904 to 1922, with stonemasons working in the mountains from March to mid-October each year. Some stones from the cairns were used to build it.[25] In April 2006, a man was killed on Slieve Donard after being struck by lightning. A brass plaque on the summit commemorates him.[26] See also[edit] List of mountains in Ireland List of Irish counties by highest point References[edit] ^ a b c d e MountainViews.ie ^ a b c Ordnance Survey Ireland – Online map viewer ^ Placenames Database of Ireland ^ Ken Stewart (2004).

Henry de Raleigh (died 1301)
Sir Henry de Raleigh (died 1301) was a knight from Devonshire, England, whose effigy in the form of a cross-legged crusader knight survives in Exeter Cathedral.
Effigy commonly supposed to represent Henry de Raleigh (d.1301), the westernmost of an adjacent pair of so-called "crusader" effigies, north wall of south choir aisle/ambulatory, Exeter Cathedral[1] Chequy or and gules, a chief vair, the arms of Raleigh of Raleigh Pilton, later adopted by Chichester Sir Henry de Raleigh (died 1301) was a knight from Devonshire, England, whose effigy in the form of a cross-legged crusader knight survives in Exeter Cathedral. Contents 1 Origins 2 Death & burial 3 Monument in Exeter Cathedral 4 Sources 5 Further reading 6 References Origins[edit] Arms of de Bohun: Azure, a bend argent cotised or between six lions rampant of the last, seen by Leland and Pole on one of the two adjacent crusader effigies in Exeter Cathedral, the other of which displayed de Raleigh/Chichester The place of his origin is unclear from surviving records, but he was probably a member of the prominent de Raleigh family seated at the manor of Raleigh in the parish of Pilton, near Barnstaple in North Devon. In the 16th century the arms of Checquy a chief vair were recorded by the antiquarian John Leland as painted on the shield of his effigy in Exeter Cathedral, of which arms no trace remains in 2016. These arms were later adopted by the prominent Chichester family, the heirs of de Raleigh of Raleigh, Pilton, who were seated at Raleigh, Pilton, for many generations. The Devon historian Sir William Pole (d.1635) wrote as follows concerning Exeter Cathedral: "Twoe knightes lye together in the wall wch devideth the quire & ye ambulatory, the on(e) wth the armes of Bohun on his shield & ye other wth the armes of Ralegh of Ralegh: vid. Checque, or & geules a chief verry".[2] The Bohun knight was possibly connected with Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, 2nd Earl of Essex (c.1249-c.1298), who is however known to have been buried at Saffron Walden Priory in Essex. His son and heir was Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford (1276-1322) one of whose daughters was Margaret de Bohun (1311-1391), the wife of Hugh Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (d.1377), of Tiverton Castle, whose effigies lie a few feet away from the Bohun/Raleigh knightly effigies, in the south transept of Exeter Cathedral, but were originally situated in a chantry chapel on the south side of the nave. Pole's descendant Sir John de la Pole, 6th Baronet (1757-1799), who published his ancestor's manuscripts in 1791 as "Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon", added a footnote to Pole's observation as follows: "These are now the arms of Chichester, whose ancestor married the heiress of Ralegh, whereby that estate came to Chichester, who probably took the arms of Ralegh".[3] Death & burial[edit] He is known to have died whilst living at the Dominican Friary in Exeter, whence his body was forcibly removed by two Cathedral canons, including Walter de Stapledon (d.1326), later Bishop of Exeter, and given burial in the Cathedral.[4] Monument in Exeter Cathedral[edit] Cross-legged effigies of two knights, believed to represent Sir Henry de Raleigh (d.1301), left, and Sir Humphrey de Bohun, order uncertain. South choir aisle/ambulatory, Exeter Cathedral, looking westwards It is not certain which of the two contemporary effigies of cross-legged knights situated next to each other under separate niches set into the north wall of the south ambulatory of Exeter Cathedral represents Raleigh. Orme (2008) is one of the few commentators who has attempted to decide the matter, and he selected the westernmost (left-hand) effigy, under the arched canopy, as representing Raleigh, thus assigning de Bohun to the easternmost effigy, under the ogee-shaped canopy. The cross-legged and "lively" form of these effigies, of which several exist elsewhere in England, most notably in the Temple Church in the City of London, are generally supposed to represent crusaders, possibly members of the Knights Templar order.

Like Rogue Trooper, he is a Genetic Infantryman fighting on the planet Nu-Earth, although the connection between the two characters were initially unclear. At one point he also teamed up with Venus Bluegenes. Contents 1 Publication history 2 Plot 3 Bibliography 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References Publication history[edit] On the strength of the success of Watchmen, the editorial staff of 2000 AD asked Dave Gibbons if he would be interested in redesigning the Rogue Trooper character. Gibbons accepted and proposed also writing it, which was greenlit by Richard Burton. However, time commitments would not allow him to both write it and provide the stories art and Will Simpson was brought in to cover the art duties.[1] Gibbons says the redesign "was my chance to put everything into Rogue Trooper I wanted and take out all the crap, like the bio-chips"[2] The fourteen-part story was hit by scheduling problems due to the lateness of the art. Gibbons said "I'm still quite happy with the story, although the way it was serialised was erratic - in for two issues, then out again. I was trying to have something that was quite cumulative."[2] Michael Fleisher took over the writing of the series with artists Ron Smith, Simon Coleby and Chris Weston. Editor Alan McKenzie has declared about the new writer: "on paper Fleisher was a good bet. ... But his work on 2000 AD was embarrassing. I did my best to save it, but you can't polish a turd."[3] After five stories Steve White was brought in to help address some problems. According to editor John Tomlinson "Ever since "War Machine" in 1989, readers had been confused as hell about who is Friday and whether he was the original Rogue. I told Steve to figure that out and explain it"[4] This led to a two-year-long run on the series for the writer, although there was a move to hand the series to Mark Millar which only resulted in a three-part story.[4] During this period Friday met both Judge Dredd, in an issue-length story,[5] and the Rogue Trooper,[6] the latter being designed to settle the issue of their origins and connections. Unfortunately, according to Tomlinson "Steve came up with a fairly watertight explanation, but it was enormously complicated and probably confused far more people than it enlightened."[7] That story also brought in Venus Bluegenes, a G.I. Doll, who would appear in one more story[8] before her appearance in the final story to feature Friday. Dan Abnett, co-author for that story, was complimentary of White's work, "Steve had such a great feel for military goings on," however, this couldn't overcome intrinsic problems with the story as "he was absolutely hamstrung by the weight of continuity."[9] The two characters disappeared into a black hole and have not reappeared since. Plot[edit] Friday's adventures are a retcon of the Rogue Trooper storyline. Since all the G.I.s were identical and had serial numbers instead of names, they gave each other descriptive nicknames to tell each other apart. "Top" (G.I. #01), the G.I. company sergeant and field-radioman, is equivalent to Helm. He has an upgraded version of the standard issue G.I. helmet with improved sensors, increased communications range and multiple channels. "Eightball" (G.I. #08), the unit sniper, is equivalent to Gunnar. He has a rifle with enhanced sensors and a more powerful electronic sight. "Lucky" (G.I. #13), the unit Equipment Man, is equivalent to Bagman. He has a Backpack with extra equipment, including Caustic Foam Dispensers and over-the-shoulder lighting mechanism. "Friday" (G.I. #19) is equivalent to Rogue. He seems to be less dogmatic and is stronger-willed than the other G.I.s.

Contents 1 Work 2 Background 3 The Emmys 4 Boards and awards 5 Books authored 6 References Work[edit] Brian coined the term ‘cross-platform’ in 1998 as Managing Director of Convergent Media "[1]" at Pittard Sullivan to describe client, TVGuide, brand and functionality presence across multiple platforms. He advocates for the concept of ongoing conversation and collaboration between the storyteller and the audience. Brian serves as Executive Producer and strategist on “Tim Kring’s Conspiracy for Good” where he also coined the term “social benefit storytelling," a technique that allows the audience to become part of the story, focusing on making a real-world difference. A proponent of “informed collaboration” between storytellers and technologists, Hurst is a member of the producing team for Tim Kring’s Conspiracy for Good, a fictional organization in an augmented reality drama popularizing the social benefits of storytelling by funding 50 scholarships and providing over 10,000 books for the Zambian libraries through WeGiveBooks.org. Background[edit] Brian was introduced to radio and television at an early age. He is the son of Philadelphia Radio and Television personality Ed Hurst of The Steel Pier Show, “Summertime on the Pier” and in the 1950s WPEN Radio’s “Grady & Hurst 950 Club." His mother, Sarajane Hurst, was Philadelphia’s first woman television producer. She served as president of the Philadelphia Chapter of American Women in Radio and Television. While in college Brian served as assistant to the producer, his mother, while she produced multiple years of the Philadelphia segment of “The Variety Club Telethon.” In 2006, Brian developed and launched the Rapid Cross Media Initiative to assist broadcast clients to extend their programming to audiences and communities on new platforms. The vision, according to Hurst, was to allow for the maximization of assets and best-in-class technology vendors to “talk to each other” and to be efficiently integrated into the production process. As a consultant Hurst promoted this idea while helping develop the original user experience for TiVo, a DVR and multi-room experience. The Emmys[edit] Brian Seth Hurst helped establish the Primetime Emmy® for Interactive Television, which is how the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences’ Interactive Media Peer Group provides a forum for individuals contributing to the evolution of cross-platform engagement between creators and fans.

Ezhava Siva
Ezhava is a caste in Kerala. Shiva is a Hindu god. Ezhava Siva refers to Siva idol consecrated by social reformer Sree Narayana Guru at Aruvippuram, in 1888. This was major break from tradition as installation of idols by non Brahmins was considered blasphemy and Sree Narayana Guru belonged to the lower caste Ezhava community. [1]
Ezhava is a caste in Kerala. Shiva is a Hindu god. Ezhava Siva refers to Siva idol consecrated by social reformer Sree Narayana Guru at Aruvippuram, in 1888. This was major break from tradition as installation of idols by non Brahmins was considered blasphemy and Sree Narayana Guru belonged to the lower caste Ezhava community. [1] Contents 1 Consecration of Ezhava Siva Lingam at Aruvippuram 2 Legacy 3 References 4 See also Consecration of Ezhava Siva Lingam at Aruvippuram[edit] Till early part of 20th century, Ezhavas and other lower castes were not allowed inside Hindu temples. During Sree Narayana Guru's wandering life he happened to be at Aruvippuram in 1888. He decided to build a place of worship for Ezhavas. He picked up a stone from near by Neyyar river and used it as an idol for the proposed temple and consecrated it. [1][2] This act challenged age old Brahmin hegemony. When many Brahmin priests questioned his right to do so, he replied famously that what he installed was an "Ezhava Siva". Thus leaving those questioned tongue tied. [1][2] He also set up temples at Aluva, Vypin, Cherai, and Moothakunnam. Legacy[edit] Narayana Guru's actions are widely acknowledged to have paved way for later movements by lower castes for temple entry, including the ‘Vaikom Satyagraha’. 125th Anniversary of Aruvippuram installation was celebrated in 2013. [1][2] Minister of State for Human Resource Development Shashi Tharoor inaugurated the function marking the 125 years of the consecration of the Aruvippuram Shiva Temple.

Saopha
Saopha, sao pha, chaofa, sawbwa, or saw-bwa (????????, pronounced: [s?? bwá]; Shan: ???????, literally meaning "lord of the heavens"[1] or "lord of the sky"[2]) was a royal title used by the hereditary rulers of the semi-independent Shan States (Mong, Shan: ??????, pronounced [m???]) in what today is Eastern Myanmar (Burma). It may also be used for rulers of similar Tai/Dai states in neighbouring countries, notably including China's Yunnan Province.[1]
"Sawbwa" redirects here. For the fish, see Sawbwa barb. Two Shan saophas on a visit to Delhi, India in 1903 Wife and child of the Saopha of Wuntho, c. 1880 Saopha, sao pha, chaofa, sawbwa, or saw-bwa (????????, pronounced: [s?? bwá]; Shan: ???????, literally meaning "lord of the heavens"[1] or "lord of the sky"[2]) was a royal title used by the hereditary rulers of the semi-independent Shan States (Mong, Shan: ??????, pronounced [m???]) in what today is Eastern Myanmar (Burma). It may also be used for rulers of similar Tai/Dai states in neighbouring countries, notably including China's Yunnan Province.[1] Chao Fa (Thai: ???????) is the Thai equivalent.[1] Chao means "master" or "lord", and Fa means "sky" or "heaven". According to local chronicles, some dynasties of saophas date from as early as the 2nd century BCE; however, the earlier sections of these chronicles are generally agreed to be legendary.[3] During British colonial rule, there were 14 to 16 saophas at a time, each ruling a highly autonomous state, until 1922 when the Federated Shan States were formed and the saophas' powers were reduced. However, they nominally kept their positions as well as their courts and still played a role in local administration until they collectively relinquished their titles in favour of the Union of Burma in 1959.[1] See also[edit] List of rulers of Shan states References[edit] ^ a b c d Donald M.

Louisiana Territory

For the 1953 film, see Louisiana Territory (film). Not to be confused with the Territory of Orleans, the organized incorporated territory that became the State of Louisiana in 1812.

Louisiana Territory was formed out of the Indiana Territory -administered District of Louisiana, which consisted of all Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 33rd parallel. The 33rd parallel now forms the southern border of Arkansas and the northern border of Louisiana. The territory's predecessor, the District of Louisiana, as well as the District of Orleans, were formed from the lands acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase, in which colonial Louisiana was purchased from France. Contents 1 Background 2 Establishing the Louisiana Territory 3 Boundaries 4 Subdivisions 5 Government 6 Renamed as Territory of Missouri 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Background[edit] The Eighth Congress of the United States on March 26, 1804, passed legislation entitled "An act erecting Louisiana into two territories, and providing for the temporary government thereof,"[1] which established the Territory of Orleans and the civil District of Louisiana. This act, which went into effect on October 1, 1804, expanded the authority of the governor and judges of the Indiana Territory to provide temporary jurisdiction over the District of Louisiana. Establishing the Louisiana Territory[edit] On March 3, 1805, Congress enacted legislation organizing the District of Louisiana into the Louisiana Territory, effective July 4, 1805. The Territory was governed similarly to Indiana Territory.[2] Boundaries[edit] The Louisiana Territory included everything in the Louisiana Purchase north of the 33rd parallel (the southern boundary of the present state of Arkansas). The southern and western boundaries with Spanish Texas and New Mexico were not fully defined until the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. Subdivisions[edit] The Louisiana Territory had five subdivisions: St. Louis District, St. Charles District, Ste. Genevieve District, Cape Girardeau District, and New Madrid District. In 1806, the territorial legislature created the District of Arkansas from lands ceded by the Osage Nation. The remainder was known as the Upper Louisiana Territory.[citation needed] Government[edit] The seat of government was in the town of St. Louis. The first territorial governor was James Wilkinson, appointed by President Jefferson and concurrently holding the position of Senior Officer of the United States Army. Meriwether Lewis (1807–1809) and William Clark (1813–1820) served as the second and third Louisiana Territory governors, respectively.[citation needed] Renamed as Territory of Missouri[edit] On June 4, 1812, the Twelfth U.S. Congress enacted legislation which renamed Louisiana Territory as Missouri Territory, in order to avoid confusion with the recently admitted State of Louisiana.[3] See also[edit] Missouri portal Arkansas portal Texas portal Iowa portal Minnesota portal Kansas portal Nebraska portal Colorado portal North Dakota portal Montana portal Wyoming portal Saskatchewan portal Alberta portal Oklahoma portal New Mexico portal History portal Historic regions of the United States History of Missouri Territorial evolution of the United States Territories of Spain that encompassed land that would later become part of the Territory of Louisiana: Santa Fé de Nuevo Méjico, 1598–1821 Tejas, 1690–1821 Luisiana, 1764–1803 Territory of France that encompassed land that would later become part of the Territory of Louisiana: Louisiane, 1682–1764 and 1803 U.S. territories that would later become part of the Territory of Louisiana: Louisiana Purchase, 1803–1804 District of Louisiana, 1804–1805 U.S. territories that included territory that was previously part of the Territory of Louisiana: Territory of Missouri, 1812–1821 Territory of Arkansaw, 1819–1836 Indian Territory, 1834–1907 Territory of Iowa, 1838–1849 Territory of Minnesota, 1849–1858 Territory of New Mexico, 1850–1912 Territory of Kansas, 1854–1861 Territory of Nebraska, 1854–1867 Territory of Colorado, 1861–1876 Territory of Dakota, 1861–1889 Territory of Montana, 1864–1889 Territory of Wyoming, 1868–1890 Territory of Oklahoma, 1890–1907 U.S. states that include territory that was once part of the Territory of Louisiana: State of Missouri, 1821 State of Arkansas, 1836 State of Texas, 1845 State of Iowa, 1846 State of Minnesota, 1858 State of Kansas, 1861 State of Nebraska, 1867 State of Colorado, 1876 State of North Dakota, 1889 State of South Dakota, 1889 State of Montana, 1889 State of Wyoming, 1890 State of Oklahoma, 1907 State of New Mexico, 1912 Territorial evolution of Canada Provinces of Canada that encompass land in the Missouri River drainage basin: Saskatchewan, 1905 Alberta, 1905 References[edit] ^ "An act erecting Louisiana into two territories, and providing for the temporary government thereof".

He studied Art at the School of Design of the Gordon Memorial College, currently the University of Khartoum. On the basis of a scholarship, he subsequently went to the Slade School of Fine Art in London from 1954 to 1957. He also stayed in Perugia in Italy for some time, to enlarge his knowledge of renaissance art. Back in Sudan, he taught at the School for Applied Arts in Khartoum.[1][2] In 1962 he received a UNESCO to the United States, from where he visited South America. From 1964 to 1965 he returned to the US with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, and in 1966 he led the Sudanese delegation during the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar, Senegal.[1][2] El-Salahi was assistant cultural attaché at the Sudanese Embassy in London from 1969 to 1972, when he returned to Sudan as Director of Culture, then Undersecretary in the Ministry of Culture and Information until September 1975, when he was imprisoned without charge for six months. Afterwards he left the country, working for some years in Doha, Qatar, before settling in Oxford, England.[1][2] Art[edit] External video Ibrahim El-Salahi,[3] He is considered a pioneer in Sudanese art and was a member of the "Khartoum School" that was founded by Osman Waqialla. In the 1960s he was associated with the Mbari Club in Ibadan, Nigeria.[1][2] He developed an own style and was one of the first artists to elaborate the Arabic calligraphy in his paintings. His work has developed through several phases. His first period during the 1950s, '60s and '70s is dominated by elementary forms and lines. Then his work becomes rather meditative, abstract and organic. Subsequently his work is characterized by lines, while he mainly uses white and black paint.[1][2] In 2001, Ibrahim el-Salahi was honored with a Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands.[4][5] In the summer of 2013 a major retrospective show of El-Salahi's work was mounted at Tate Modern, London, running from 3 July to 22 September 2013. The Tate's first retrospective dedicated to an African artist.

Jerry Heller
Gerald E. "Jerry" Heller (October 6, 1940 – September 2, 2016) was an American music manager and businessman. He was best known for managing west coast rap supergroup and gangsta rap pioneers N.W.A and Eazy-E. He rose to prominence in the 1960s and '70s, importing Elton John and Pink Floyd for their first major American tours, and representing Journey, Marvin Gaye, Van Morrison, War, Eric Burdon, Crosby Stills and Nash, Ike & Tina Turner, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Otis Redding, The Who, Black Sabbath, Humble Pie, Styx, The Grass Roots and The Standells, among many others.

"Jerry" Heller (October 6, 1940 – September 2, 2016) was an American music manager and businessman. He was best known for managing west coast rap supergroup and gangsta rap pioneers N.W.A and Eazy-E. He rose to prominence in the 1960s and '70s, importing Elton John and Pink Floyd for their first major American tours, and representing Journey, Marvin Gaye, Van Morrison, War, Eric Burdon, Crosby Stills and Nash, Ike & Tina Turner, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Otis Redding, The Who, Black Sabbath, Humble Pie, Styx, The Grass Roots and The Standells, among many others. In the mid-1980s he worked with R&B and hip hop acts like Michel'le, World Class Wreckin' Cru, J.J. Fad, The D.O.C., Egyptian Lover and L.A. Dream Team. Heller played a role in the emergence of West Coast rap music when he cofounded Ruthless Records with Eazy-E and discovered, signed or managed the likes of N.W.A, The Black Eyed Peas, Above the Law, The D.O.C. and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Heller suffered from a heart attack while driving, resulting in an auto accident. He later died on September 2, 2016 in Thousand Oaks, California.[1][2][3] Contents 1 Early life and education 2 Career 2.1 Managing the rise of West Coast rap 2.2 Death Row Records and Jewish Defense League 2.3 After N.W.A 2.4 Book 2.5 Straight Outta Compton lawsuit 3 Death 4 In popular culture 5 References 6 External links Early life and education[edit] Born to a Jewish family in Cleveland, Ohio,[4] Heller served in the United States Army and attended college at University of Southern California, Heller started working in the agency business in 1963. After working at Coast Artists, Associated Booking and the Chartwell, he opened the Heller-Fischel Agency in Beverly Hills, California which grossed $1.9 million during its first year, $3.7 million the second, $5.8 the third, and over $7 million its fourth year of operation representing rock stars The Who, Grand Funk Railroad, Black Sabbath, Humble Pie, and Black Oak Arkansas as well as writers at the time Carly Simon, Van Morrison, and Cat Stevens. He later bought out partner Don Fischel who went on to package independent TV productions. Heller believed that a key factor in keeping acts working between or after a hit record was to not be greedy and package his own clients together, but tour them in salable packages with other headline acts that were clients of other agencies.[5] Career[edit] Starting in the mid-1980s, Heller represented rap musicians as the genre became popular with the record-buying U.S. public.[citation needed] His work with Ruthless Records and with Eazy-E formed the foundation for the successes of Priority Records and Interscope Records. To date, Ruthless Records has sold in excess of 110 million records, not counting singles. The label included artists and producers such as Dr. Dre, whose careers Heller helped establish sold millions of records for Interscope Records, Priority Records, Atlantic Records, MCA Records, and Sony Records. At the time of Eazy-E's death, and Heller's departure from Ruthless Records, the company was pulling in excess of $10 million per month. Managing the rise of West Coast rap[edit] In the 1980s, Heller began managing acts on the nascent Los Angeles hip hop scene, many of whom recorded for the now defunct Macola Records in Hollywood. He managed both C.I.A., which Ice Cube was a member of, and the World Class Wreckin' Cru, which included Dr. Dre and DJ Yella.[citation needed] On March 3, 1987, he met Compton, California rapper Eazy-E, and the two became co-founders of Ruthless Records.[6] Under the direction of Heller and Eazy, Ruthless Records had six platinum releases in three years: Supersonic (J. J. Fad), Eazy-Duz-It (Eazy-E), Straight Outta Compton (N.W.A), No One Can Do It Better (The D.O.C.), Michel'le's self-titled debut, and Niggaz4Life (N.W.A). Death Row Records and Jewish Defense League[edit] During Dr. Dre’s departure from Ruthless Records, Heller and Ruthless director of business affairs Mike Klein sought assistance from the Jewish Defense League. The JDL offered to provide bodyguards to Eazy-E when Suge Knight allegedly threatened him in the early 1990s. The presence of bodyguards provided Ruthless Records with muscle to enter into negotiations with Knight over Dr. Dre’s departure. The Federal Bureau of Investigation launched a money laundering investigation, assuming that the JDL was extorting money from Ruthless Records. JDL spokesperson Irv Rubin issued a press release stating, "There was nothing but a close, tight relationship" between Eazy-E and the League. Heller explained that JDL’s involvement with Ruthless was for more reasons than the FBI investigation. Heller claimed Eazy-E received death threats and it was discovered that he was on a Nazi skinhead hit list. Heller speculated that placement on the hit list might have been because of N.W.A's song "Fuck tha Police." Heller said, "It was no secret that in the aftermath of the Suge Knight shakedown incident where Eazy was forced to sign over Dr. Dre, Michel'le, and The D.O.C., that Ruthless was protected by Israeli trained/connected security forces." Heller has maintained that Eazy-E admired the JDL for their slogan "Never Again" and that he had plans to make a movie about the group.[citation needed] After N.W.A[edit] N.W.A broke up in 1991, with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre departing and aiming criticism at Heller and Eazy in diss tracks. Both Ice Cube and Dre accused Heller of breaking up N.W.A with the way he managed the group. Dr. Dre later recalled: "The split came when Jerry Heller got involved. He played the divide and conquer game. Instead of taking care of everybody, he picked one nigga to take care of and that was Eazy. And Eazy was like, 'I'm taken care of, so fuck it'."[7] Ice Cube, in his diss track "No Vaseline", accused Eazy of being too much under Heller's influence and both of them exploiting the rest of the group: "Eazy E-turned-faggot/With your manager, fella/fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella". Also, "It's a case of divide and conquer, 'cause you let a Jew break up my crew" and "house nigga gotta run and hide, yellin' Compton but you moved to Riverside."[8] Book[edit] Heller's memoir, Ruthless: A Memoir, written with Gil Reavill, was published by Simon & Schuster/Simon Spotlight Entertainment in 2006.[9][10] In the work, Heller addressed many events that he had previously remained silent on. With regards to the FBI letter sent after the NWA song Fuck tha Police, Heller wrote that the letter was actually a rogue action by a "single pissed-off bureaucrat with a bully pulpit" named Milt Ahlerich, who was falsely purporting to represent the FBI as a whole and that the action "earned him a transfer to the Bureau's backwater Hartford office".[11] He also wrote that he removed all sensitive documents from the office of Ruthless Records in case of an FBI raid.[11] He denied the accusations of financial impropriety.[12] In particular, he wrote that Ice Cube didn't understand finances, and subsequently failed to pay producers and writers on his own record label.[12] He claimed that the 20% that he took of earnings was lower than the 25% that became standard at Lench Mob Records.[13] Of the song "No Vaseline", Heller wrote that he didn't believe that Ice Cube was genuinely anti-Semitic and was nothing but "pro-Ice Cube", but had exploited prejudices in the Afro-American community to help his career.[14] He claimed that the deathbed letter from Eazy-E was a forgery: "Eric would never have put out a letter that was that corny."[15] Heller wrote that Eazy-E had eight children and not seven as the letter stated.[15] Of the Dee Barnes incident, in which she was beaten by Dr. Dre in the midst of the feud between Ice Cube and the remaining members of N.W.A, Heller called the incident "disgraceful" and that he was "left to clean up the mess".[16] Heller said that Dr. Dre was generally non-violent and mild-mannered, but had drunk too much on the night.[16] In a 2013 interview, on the Murder Master Music Show, Heller said that Eazy-E had planned on killing Suge Knight, but Heller was able to talk Eazy out of it. Heller said he was in his office when Eazy-E told him, “You know this guy Suge Knight? Well, I’m gonna kill him… This guy’s gonna be a problem, and I’m gonna kill him.” Heller said that he told Eazy it didn't make sense to kill Knight and it wouldn't be worth the risk, citing that Ruthless Records was the most successful startup record company ever, making $10 million a month with only 6 employees and, as Heller put it, "not even having a typewriter in their office." Heller said that, given everything that had transpired afterward, he regrets talking Eazy out of it. "You know something? I should have let him kill him. I would have done the world a favor. He would have done it for sure by himself. He always rolled by himself and he was fearless. I think that he was going to go do it. I took him seriously. He was right and I was wrong."[17] Straight Outta Compton lawsuit[edit] In October 2015, Heller filed a lawsuit against several members of N.W.A, NBCUniversal, and others involved in the production of the biopic Straight Outta Compton.[18] He has also filed lawsuits against rappers Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. The lawsuit claims "the film is littered with false statements that harm the reputation of (Heller) and aim to ridicule and lower him in the opinion of the community and to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him."[18] Producers for the film, which included Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, filed a countersuit in February 2016 to have portions of the Heller suit thrown out.[19] In June 2016, U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald dismissed nearly all of Heller's lawsuit, but agreed to allow one key claim to continue.[20] Death[edit] Heller, having had a history of heart problems and diabetes, was driving on September 2, 2016 when he had a heart attack, crashed his car, and later died at a hospital in Thousand Oaks, California. He was 75 years old.[1][2][21] In popular culture[edit] Heller was portrayed by actor Paul Giamatti in a 2015 biopic film, titled Straight Outta Compton, about N.W.A., Ruthless Records, Eazy E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and others.[22] References[edit] This article uses bare URLs for citations, which may be threatened by link rot.

John Clark Milne
John Clark Milne (1897-1962) was a Scottish poet who wrote in the Doric dialect of the Scots language. He was also a teacher and educationalist.[1] Some of his poetry was written for children.[2]
John Clark Milne Born 1897 Memsie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland Died 1962 Nationality Scottish Occupation Poet Known for The Orra Loon John Clark Milne (1897-1962) was a Scottish poet who wrote in the Doric dialect of the Scots language. He was also a teacher and educationalist.[1] Some of his poetry was written for children.[2] Contents 1 Life 2 Work 3 Bibliography 4 References Life[edit] John Milne was born at Memsie, near Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire in 1897 to a farming family. He attended the University of Aberdeen where he excelled academically, then became a teacher. In later years he was Master of Method at Aberdeen College of Education. His collection of verses, The Orra Loon was published in 1946 and his collected Poems in 1963.[3] The northeastern poet and novelist Nan Shepherd helped prepare the latter edition of Milne's poetry, published after his death.[4] In 2009 the Buchan Heritage Society launched a CD on which well-known local performers and artists had collaborated in recording samples of his work. The society hoped that through hearing Milne's unique poetry children would help preserve the Doric tongue, which many in the area have forgotten.[5] Work[edit] According to Cuthbert Graham, "The imaginative literature of Aberdeen for the past century has been dominated by a single theme–a single myth if you like in the deep psychological sense–a passion for the land... In poetry Charles Murray, John C. Milne and Flora Garry have illuminated the same obsessive concern."[6] J.C. Milne's work was full of humorous irony, through which he could express his unique viewpoint while apparently reporting the speech of the characters he depicted.[7] Milne had an extraordinary ability to exploit the potential for rhyming in the dialect.[8] Rich in vocabulary, his poetry seemed simple and unaffected.[9] A snatch of Milne's poetry, with the wonderful word "contermashious", meaning "contrary": O Lord look doon on Buchan An a' its fairmer chiels! For there's nae in a' Yer warld Mair contermashious deils![10] Bibliography[edit] Milne, John Clark (1946). THE ORRA LOON and Other Poems. Geo E. Findlay & Co Ltd.  Milne, John Clark (1963). Poems.

Mordecai Buckner
Seven Years' War
Mordecai Buckner Born ca. 1735 Died 1787 Spotsylvania County, Virginia Allegiance  United States Years of service  United Kingdom 1755–1762  United States 1776–1777 Rank Colonel (Continental Army) Battles/wars Seven Years' War French and Indian War American Revolutionary War Battle of Trenton (1776) Mordecai Buckner (ca. 1735 – 1787)[1] was born in colonial Virginia and served as an officer in the French and Indian War. After the start of the American Revolutionary War he was appointed colonel of the 6th Virginia Regiment. He served in this capacity for about one year before he was cashiered and dismissed from the Continental Army. Buckner was the son of Thomas Buckner (died ca. 1755), a planter of Caroline Co., Virginia, who served as a justice of the peace and sheriff of that county, and Mary Timson. He married Elizabeth Beverly Chew in 1767 and the couple had at least two known children. Career[edit] Buckner was first appointed quartermaster in 1755,[2] then ensign later that year for then-Capt. Adam Stephen's militia company, and in 1758 during the French and Indian War, he was promoted to captain in Adam Stephen's Virginia regiment. He either rejoined the regiment or was still serving in 1762, for which he received 3,000 acres of land. In 1767, he married Elizabeth Beverly Chew, widow of Beverly Stanard.[3] During the colonial militia buildup at the onset of the American Revolution, on 12 Sep 1775, Buckner was elected lieutenant colonel of the minutemen raised by the combined Virginia counties of Spottsylvania, Caroline, Stafford, and King George under Col. Hugh Mercer.[4] Both Buckner and Mercer were members of the Spottsylvania County committee. Having served under George Washington during the earlier war, he was not long after appointed commander of the 6th Virginia Regiment in the nascent Continental Army. His colonel's commission dated from 13 February 1776.[5] The two other field officers were Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Elliott and Major James Hendricks.[6] The regiment came into existence on 28 December 1775. It was organized at Williamsburg, Virginia in the strength of ten companies from men of ten different eastern and southern counties. Initially assigned to the Southern Department, the unit transferred to Stephen's Brigade in Washington's main army on 3 September 1776.[7] Buckner commanded the 191-strong 6th Virginia at the Battle of Trenton on 26 December 1776.[8] At that time, Hendricks was lieutenant colonel and Richard Parker was major.[6] For reasons not given, Parker led the regiment at the battles of Assunpink Creek and Princeton on 2 and 3 January 1777.[9] On 23 January, separate actions were fought at Bonhamtown, Quibbletown, and Woodbridge, New Jersey during the Forage War.[10] In one of these encounters, Buckner's subordinate, Lt. Col. Parker, engaged British troops but was unable to press what he felt was a significant advantage because Buckner failed to bring up support, having in fact fled the battle. Buckner was accused of misbehavior in combat and subsequently arrested for trial. While on parole, he attempted to flee and was reapprehended by a troop of light horse sent by General Washington. Buckner wrote a letter to the commander-in-chief pleading to be dismissed from the service without trial, but on 28 January 1777, Washington wrote him a curt letter in reply. Sir: It is not in my power to comply with your request on three Accounts, yourself, the Country at large, and the State you come from, Were the matter to remain undetermined, your Reputation must be ruined; at all events, every Officer would have reason to expect equal favor, and I shall be justly taxed with partiality. Would you reflect on the Impropriety of your Petition, you would certainly withdraw it. Resolved as I am to reward merit, and punish demerit, I shall refer your case to the judgment of a Court Martial, and shall be happy to hear that it acquits you. I am, etc.[11] On 8 February Buckner was tried before a court martial and found guilty. The General Court Martial held at Chatham, the 8th. Inst: whereof Brigadier General St. Clair was President, for the trial of Col Mordecai Buckner, accused of "Shamefully Misbehaving before the Enemy, in the Action of the 23rd. of Jan'y last," And of "Quitting his post and party in time of engagement," have after mature consideration, sentenced the said Col Mordecai Buckner, to be cashiered, and declared incapable of any military office, in the service of the United States. The General and Commander in Chief approves the sentence, and orders the said Col Mordecai Buckner, forthwith to depart the American Army.[12] Capt. John Chilton, who sat on the court martial, opined that "there was but a single circumstance that saved him being shot."[13] Buckner left the army on 9 February 1777 and Hendricks succeeded him as acting commander.[6] During his life Buckner amassed considerable wealth, but he lost much of it by the time he died around 1787. His will was proven on 1 January 1788. He and his wife had two surviving children, John Chew (1770–1820) and Baldwin Matthews (20 April 1772–27 December 1827).[3] Baldwin was born at the family estate at Roxbury in Spotsylvania County and died at Chestnut Hill in Greene County, Virginia.[14] Notes[edit] Biography portal ^ The birth year of 1740 given by some secondary sources is unlikely as that would have made him only 15 years old at the time of his appointment as quartermaster and then ensign. ^ Virginia County Records, W.A.

He won the makushita division championship in November 1986 with a perfect 7–0 record and was promoted to the sekitori ranks after that tournament. He had been using his family name of Kuga as his ring name, but upon his promotion he was given the shikona of Kitakachidoki, or "northern battle-cry," a reference to his Hokkaid? birthplace in the north of the country.[3] He had few other wrestlers in his stable at a similar rank to him (former maegashira Hattori Yuji being forced to retire through injury around that time) and he had to go to other stables in his Tokitsukaze ichimon or stable group to find quality training partners.[2] He reached the top makuuchi division for the first time in January 1989, but was demoted back to the second juryo division after only one tournament. He did not establish himself as a top division regular until 1991. He fought in makuuchi for 49 tournaments in total, with a 331–389 win/loss record.[4] He never managed to reach a sanyaku rank, his highest position in the banzuke being maegashira 3 in March 1994. He was also unable to defeat a yokozuna or win a special prize. His final appearance in the top division was in May 1998, although he continued to compete in the juryo division for two years after that. His demotion meant there were no longer any Hokkaid? natives in the top division, a remarkable decline considering that in the early 1990s there were three yokozuna (Chiyonofuji, Hokutoumi, and Onokuni) from Hokkaid? on the banzuke. Retirement from sumo[edit] After a poor 5–10 record in July 2000, and facing certain demotion to the unsalaried makushita division, Kitakachidoki announced his retirement at the age of thirty four. He had fought in 1438 matches across 117 tournaments.[4] On 22 August 2000 he became an elder in the Japan Sumo Association, acquiring the vacant elder name of Katsunora Oyakata. He worked as a coach at Isenoumi stable, and in September 2011 he took over as head of the stable when his old boss, former sekiwake Fujinokawa, reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. Now known as Isenoumi Oyakata, he oversaw the promotion of Ikioi to the top division in 2012. Fighting style[edit] His most common winning kimarite or technique was yori-kiri or force out, where he preferred a right hand inside grip (migi-yotsu) on his opponent's mawashi or belt.[2] He was also fond of hip throws like sukui nage (scoop throw) and uwate nage (overarm throw).[2] He was only of average height and weight for the top division but had a notably muscular frame as he was a keen weight-lifter.[2] Career record[edit] Kitakachidoki Hayato[4] Year in sumo January Hatsu basho, Tokyo March Haru basho, Osaka May Natsu basho, Tokyo July Nagoya basho, Nagoya September Aki basho, Tokyo November Ky?sh? basho, Fukuoka 1981 x x (Maezumo) East Jonokuchi #31 5–2   East Jonidan #121 4–3   East Jonidan #97 5–2   1982 East Jonidan #59 4–3   West Jonidan #35 2–5   West Jonidan #60 6–1   West Sandanme #85 5–2   East Sandanme #50 4–3   East Sandanme #28 4–3   1983 East Sandanme #16 1–6   East Sandanme #51 Sat out due to injury 0–0–7 West Jonidan #12 6–1   West Sandanme #44 4–3   East Sandanme #28 3–4   East Sandanme #44 4–3   1984 East Sandanme #33 2–5   West Sandanme #61 6–1   East Sandanme #13 5–2   East Makushita #48 4–3   West Makushita #33 3–4   West Makushita #46 5–2   1985 West Makushita #26 5–2   West Makushita #12 3–4   East Makushita #19 3–4   East Makushita #31 3–4   West Makushita #39 5–2   West Makushita #23 4–3   1986 East Makushita #13 5–2   West Makushita #6 2–5   West Makushita #21 4–3   West Makushita #15 4–3   East Makushita #10 6–1   East Makushita #2 7–0 Champion   1987 West J?ry? #9 9–6   West J?ry? #6 9–6   West J?ry? #5 8–7   West J?ry? #4 7–8   East J?ry? #6 8–7   East J?ry? #4 7–8   1988 West J?ry? #5 8–7   East J?ry? #3 6–9   East J?ry? #8 8–7   West J?ry? #4 6–9   East J?ry? #9 9–6   East J?ry? #4 10–5   1989 East Maegashira #13 6–9   West J?ry? #2 9–6   West Maegashira #13 8–7   West Maegashira #10 5–10   West J?ry? #1 9–6   West Maegashira #13 6–9   1990 West J?ry? #1 10–5   East Maegashira #13 6–9   East J?ry? #2 7–8   West J?ry? #3 6–9   East J?ry? #7 8–7   West J?ry? #3 8–7   1991 West Maegashira #14 8–7   West Maegashira #10 7–8   East Maegashira #13 5–10   West J?ry? #1 8–7   West Maegashira #13 8–7   West Maegashira #9 9–6   1992 East Maegashira #4 6–9   West Maegashira #7 6–9   West Maegashira #10 8–7   West Maegashira #7 7–8   West Maegashira #9 8–7   East Maegashira #5 7–8   1993 West Maegashira #7 7–8   West Maegashira #8 8–7   West Maegashira #4 Sat out due to injury 0–0–15 West Maegashira #4 5–10   East Maegashira #9 6–9   East Maegashira #14 9–6   1994 West Maegashira #8 8–7   West Maegashira #3 6–9   West Maegashira #5 6–9   East Maegashira #8 7–8   West Maegashira #10 7–8   East Maegashira #13 9–6   1995 West Maegashira #7 7–8   East Maegashira #10 7–8   East Maegashira #12 9–6   East Maegashira #5 4–11   East Maegashira #12 8–7   East Maegashira #10 8–7   1996 West Maegashira #6 5–10   East Maegashira #12 9–6   East Maegashira #4 4–11   East Maegashira #9 8–7   West Maegashira #4 4–11   West Maegashira #9 8–7   1997 West Maegashira #5 6–9   East Maegashira #7 6–9   West Maegashira #11 7–8   West Maegashira #13 7–8   West Maegashira #14 8–7   West Maegashira #11 8–7   1998 West Maegashira #10 7–8   East Maegashira #13 8–7   East Maegashira #11 5–10   East J?ry? #1 4–11   East J?ry? #7 7–8   West J?ry? #9 8–7   1999 East J?ry? #8 8–7   East J?ry? #2 3–12   West J?ry? #9 10–5   West J?ry? #3 8–7   West J?ry? #1 7–8   West J?ry? #2 5–10   2000 West J?ry? #5 9–6   East J?ry? #3 6–9   West J?ry? #5 4–11   East J?ry? #10 5–10   East Makushita #3 Retired 0–0–0 x Record given as win-loss-absent    Top Division Champion Retired Lower Divisions Sansh? key: F=Fighting spirit; O=Outstanding performance; T=Technique     Also shown: ?=Kinboshi(s); P=Playoff(s) Divisions: Makuuchi — J?ry? — Makushita — Sandanme — Jonidan — Jonokuchi Makuuchi ranks: Yokozuna — ?zeki — Sekiwake — Komusubi — Maegashira See also[edit] Glossary of sumo terms List of past sumo wrestlers References[edit] ^ "Oyakata (Coaches)".

Contents 1 Geographic range 2 Description 3 Habitat 4 Behavior 5 Subspecies 6 Etymology 7 Captivity 8 References 9 Further reading Geographic range[edit] It is found in southern Mexico (Colima, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Yucatán), Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.[2] Description[edit] Long and thin, it can reach 70 cm (27.5 in) in total length, two-thirds of which is a thin tail. The scales on the forehead are much larger than those on the back of the head. No projecting triangular scales occur on the posterior border of the head. The gular scales are bicarinate or tricarinate.[3] Sexual dimorphism is present, but is difficult to observe. Males have a somewhat thicker tail root than females, and the hemipenes are sometimes visible when lifting the tail gently. Habitat[edit] Eastern casquehead iguanas inhabit tropical wet, moist, and seasonally dry forests. It can persist in secondary growth when suitable trees are present.[1] Behavior[edit] Eastern casquehead iguana is an arboreal species occurring high up in the trees.[1] Rather slow, it sits on trees and bushes above water courses, licking water drops on leaves, and catching insects that walk nearby. L. longipes lives individually, or in a territory with one male and one to three females. Usually, however, males and females only meet for mating, which can happen several times per year. Subspecies[edit] Three subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies.[2] L. l. deborrei Boulenger, 1877 L. l. longipes Wiegmann, 1834 L. l. waltersi Schmidt, 1933 Etymology[edit] The subspecific name, deborrei, is in honor of Belgian entomologist Charles Preudhomme de Borre.[4] The subspecific name, waltersi, is in honor of Leon L. Walters, who collected the type specimen with Karl P. Schmidt.[5] Captivity[edit] L. l. longipes A female L. longipes digging a burrow near the Mayan ruins of El Mirador, Guatemala, possibly for use as a nesting site. These lizards are sometimes bred in captivity, but they are not good terrarium companions for beginners, as they quickly and often dehydrate. Daily misting or a water-dropping system is essential. Temperatures should range between 25 and 35 °C during day, and between 20 and 23 during night. Humidity should range between 70 and 90%. They are great cricket eaters and should receive at least four or five adult crickets every day. They also need UVA and UVB lighting and an additional vitamin and calcium feed once a week.

Grey-green fruit dove
The grey-green fruit dove (Ptilinopus purpuratus) is a species of bird in the family Columbidae. It is endemic to French Polynesia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.
Grey-green fruit dove Conservation status Least Concern (IUCN 3.1)[1] Scientific classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Aves Order: Columbiformes Family: Columbidae Genus: Ptilinopus Species: P. purpuratus Binomial name Ptilinopus purpuratus (Gmelin, 1789) The grey-green fruit dove (Ptilinopus purpuratus) is a species of bird in the family Columbidae. It is endemic to French Polynesia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. Distribution and Population[edit] The grey-green fruit dove is endemic to the French Polynesian islands of Tahiti and Mo'orea. There is an estimated population of 5,000 to 10,000 mature individual birds on the two islands, of which 5,000 - 6,000 live on Mo'orea, at an estimated density of 2-3 birds per hectare.[2] Threats[edit] In 1907, the grey-green fruit dove was reportedly very abundant on the two islands. However the population has declined since then. There is an ongoing slow population decline due to habitat destruction, the introduction of non-native plants, predation by invasive species such as the swamp harrier and feral cats, and competition by invasive red-vented bulbul and common myna.[2] References[edit] ^ BirdLife International (2012).

Flying Again
Flying Again is a studio album by the country rock group The Flying Burrito Brothers, released in 1975.
Flying Again Studio album by The Flying Burrito Brothers Released October 1975 Genre Country rock Length 32:08 Label Columbia Producer Norbert Putnam, Glen Spreen The Flying Burrito Brothers chronology Close Up the Honky-Tonks (1974) Flying Again (1975) Airborne (1976) Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating AllMusic [1] Classic Rock [2] Flying Again is a studio album by the country rock group The Flying Burrito Brothers, released in 1975. After Gram Parsons' death in 1973, posthumous interest in his music grew. This interest caused the band's original label, A&M Records, to release the compilation album Close Up the Honky-Tonks. Since Rick Roberts had dissolved the Flying Burrito Brothers after a brief 1973 European tour with no original members, former manager Eddie Tickner started to think about the possibilities of reviving the band. After Tickner received booking interest from a number of clubs, founding members "Sneaky" Pete Kleinow and Chris Ethridge agreed to re-form the Burritos. They hired former Byrds drummer Gene Parsons, Joel Scott Hill from Canned Heat, and Gib Guilbeau to round out the "refried" Burritos. Tickner then got the new band a deal with Columbia Records, of which Flying Again was their label debut. Despite having two original members, the sound of this album is markedly different than the albums released by the original incarnation. The best examples of this are on the tracks "Dim Lights, Thick Smoke (And Loud, Loud Music)" and "Hot Burrito #3". "Dim Lights" is much faster and more rocking than the version recorded by the original lineup that would appear years later. While bassist Chris Ethridge had a significant hand in the writing of Hot Burrito 1 and 2, Part 3 is a jarring departure from the style of the first two episodes. The lyrics are written more as a caricature of the first two. "Building Fires" was released as a single. Track listing[edit] "Easy to Get On" (Joel Scott Hill) – 3:18 "Wind and Rain" (Gene Parsons, Gib Guilbeau) – 4:28 "Why Baby Why" (Darrell Edwards, George Jones) – 2:24 "Dim Lights, Thick Smoke (And Loud, Loud Music)" (Max Fidler, Joe Maphis, Rose Lee Maphis) – 2:16 "You Left the Water Running" (Oscar Frank, Rick Hall, Dan Penn) – 2:23 "Building Fires" (Johnny Christopher, Penn) – 4:18 "Sweet Desert Childhood" (Parsons) – 3:44 "Bon Soir Blues" (Guilbeau) – 4:11 "River Road" (Guilbeau) – 2:59 "Hot Burrito #3" (Chris Ethridge, Guilbeau, Joel Scott Hill, Pete Kleinow, Parsons) – 2:07 Personnel[edit] "Sneaky" Pete Kleinow: pedal steel guitar Chris Ethridge: bass Joel Scott Hill: vocals, guitar Gib Guilbeau: vocals, fiddle Gene Parsons: vocals, drums, guitar, harmonica References[edit] ^ Ruhlmann, William.

Menachem ben Peretz of Hebron
Menachem ben Peretz of Hebron (or Menachem ben R. Peretz of Hebron, or Menachen ben Peretz; Hebrew: ???? ???????, pronounced: Menachem ha-Hevroni, lit. Menachem of Hebron) is the alleged-name of a French Jew who spent several years in Hebron in the first quarter of the 13th century. He is described as a writer of an epistle, in which, among other things, he documented the tradition of identification of Jewish holy sites in the Land of Israel, sites which he got to know from his conversations with Jewish inhabitants of the Land of Israel during his years of residence and travels there.
Menachem ben Peretz of Hebron (or Menachem ben R. Peretz of Hebron, or Menachen ben Peretz; Hebrew: ???? ???????, pronounced: Menachem ha-Hevroni, lit. Menachem of Hebron) is the alleged-name of a French Jew who spent several years in Hebron in the first quarter of the 13th century. He is described as a writer of an epistle, in which, among other things, he documented the tradition of identification of Jewish holy sites in the Land of Israel, sites which he got to know from his conversations with Jewish inhabitants of the Land of Israel during his years of residence and travels there. Contents 1 Content 2 Credibility 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Content[edit] The treatise which contains the epistle attributed to him is made of two parts: The first part, a kind of travelogue, depicting a pilgrimage to various sites in the Land of Israel, and the second part is full of fiction stories. The second part describes Menachem as prayer leader for eight years in Hebron, and specifies a date: Tammuz, ?'????"? (1215) The depiction of the journey begins in Hebron, where the author visited the tombs of ancestors; he then continued to the tomb of the prophet Jonah, in Halhul, and from there he proceeded to Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem. From there he turns to Jerusalem, where he stayed and prayed in the presence of a large Jewish community. In Mount Zion he saw the Tombs of the Kings and was also able to see the location of the Holy Temple and the fact that the Western Wall "Still exists". From the Mount of Olives he looked out on the altar built by Ezra, and in the Valley of Josaphat he saw the Tomb of Zechariah "Who was a priest and a prophet" and the Tomb of Absalom. From that point on the journey becomes confused, and the names of the sites listed in it are not arranged in any logical order. In addition, various sites are not in the place known today. For example, he locates the tomb of Simeon bar Yochai at Kfar Hananya, and the tomb of Dinah, where the rest of the pilgrims place at Mount Arbel, he places near Nablus. The second section of the travelogue is a collection of legends, each one starting with the opening sentence: "And R. Menachem ben Peretz told us more" Adolf Neubauer was the first to publish the essay in ha-Levanon paper (V, 40, 1868, p. 626-629), and Abraham Moses Luncz thereafter published it in Ha- Me'amer (III, 1919, p. 36-46). Credibility[edit] Scholars are divided on the question of the authenticity and the letter's reliability. The manuscript is found in Oxford's Bodleian Library MS Bodl. Or. 135. Samuel Klein [1] saw it as a 19th-century forgery, but Isaiah Sonne maintained it to be an ancient manuscript of the 14th century, and Professor Malachi Beit-Arié came to the conclusion that the description of the journey, as well as the entire codex which is in the letter, were written at the beginning of the 13th century.[2] In Joshua Prawer's opinion, the letter is a fake, but this is not the work of an author of the 19th century but rather a forger of the 13th century. In his opinion it is a failed fake that uses the descriptive passages of journeys of others, journeys that were perhaps already widespread in the Western Diaspora.[3] In contrast, Elhanan Reiner sees the letter as "reliable, accurate and interesting".[4] The author himself apparently feard he would be suspected of improper motives, and so he writes in his letter: "And he who sees this letter from the names of the righteous stated above who stated names, may they not suspect me, and may they not say in their hearts that I wrote [this] for they would like me, or for to extract money from them because it is revealed and known before me those who spoke [that] the world was such, I received [this information] from Bnei Ma'araba (=The people of the Land of Israel), and if the seer will further question and say: 'How can the people of Ma'araba know? because the righteous people who were buried there, [its] 3000 years already?' and I the author will also answer them that it is from Bnei Ma'araba and not from me that it is written, because those who live in the Land of Israel today had not exiled from there to this day ... and each man received [this information] from his father from [the days of] the destruction of the temple and so they know all about it… and so I received it, Menachem of Hebron" See also[edit] Joseph's Tomb Simeon Shezuri References[edit] ^ The letter of R.

Yet when a gang of bully birds threatens his ringmaster father and takes over the circus, Cuco sets off on a hilarious and perilous journey to Hollywood to enlist his hero in his fight, only to discover the true hero within himself.

We wanted to tell a story about how borders are just a line on a map and when you are honest and you do things the right way there are a lot of possibilities out there for everybody.”[4] Bringing the project to the United States was one of the biggest challenges in the film's development.[3] Edward James Olmos served as the film's executive producer. He later met actor Edward James Olmos, when he found that Olmos was a fan of La Leyenda de la Nahuala[4] and "a hit".[20] After reading the script, Olmos agreed to join the film's production team and voice cast.[7] “We’re delighted to be working with Edward James Olmos and his production company here in the US. It’s a story we have been working on for the last three years and we feel we have a really strong team in place to execute this film scheduled in 2013.”[21] "At the opening of the FICM to present the progress of this project is important because Animex [was] born in Puebla 13 years ago, and is the fourth film and will for many more, with El Americano, we ventured to U.S. and we want to impact [a] Hollywood film [...]" — Ricardo Arnaiz[22] On 26 September 2013, the film was presented at Ibero Puebla, revealing new screenshots and clips.[23] During production, Edward James Olmos had recorded his voice before the animation process.[24] Many cast members were required to act out their roles before recording their voices.[25] According to director Ricardo Arnaiz, it is the most expensive film from Animex Producciones and the first to exceed over $29 million pesos.[20] Animation[edit] The visual effects and animation production were done by Boxel Studio in Tijuana.[4][26] Additional animation and crowding was handled by Cutting Edge Productions in Philippines.[4] In an interview with Andres Reyes Botello, founder of Boxel Studios, Ricardo Arnaiz initially stated he originally intended to produce the film in traditional animation,[26] but Edward James Olmos insisted Arnaiz use CG animation as the best chance of the film's success.[4] "Back then, he was explaining to me his situation with his 2D animation studio and his curiosity about making El Americano into a full 3D CGI production", said Andres Reyes Botello. "From there, we instantly got on to a good relationship and started working on the development for the characters and environments, doing some animation, lighting, and rendering tests for this film."[26] Arnaiz doesn't have much experience in CG animation. As a director of Nikte, he finds the transition from traditional animation to computer animation "complicated" since its vision in the field of animation was "cartoonish".[3] This was not changed with El Americano; however, Arnaiz wanted to capture some scenes in traditional animation.[3] Later, being impressed by Boxel Studios' works, Arnaiz has decided to partner with the studio, which primarily focuses on animation for video games and promotions.[4] “They were very creative, they had a lot of knowledge and I said: ‘Would you be interested in doing a movie with me? I don’t know anything about CGI, you don’t know anything about making movies — let’s combine and create this thing together,” says Arnaiz.[4] For assistance, Arnaiz tapped animation veteran Raul Garcia, and Mike Kunkel, who is Arnaiz's personal friend and longed-hoped to work with him, and brought them to Boxel Studios.[4] “They taught everyone how to make animation, Hollywood style, and in Mexico, we taught the Americans how to do it with low budgets,” said Arnaiz.[4] A total of 25 animators have worked on this film.[4] Arnaiz has stated that the development of the film was challenging.[4] However, the film was finished on time and on budget.[4] “The biggest challenge was to get it to the level that everyone was hoping for us,” said Arnaiz. “They thought at first that we were going to go to like a direct-to-video quality at the most, and once we showed them some clips they were really excited about it.”[4] Development for the film finished in August 2013.[20] Casting[edit] The film features a distinctive ensemble voice cast, primarily consisting of famous Mexican and Hispanic American actors.[3] Director Ricardo Arnaiz was satisfied with the casting, which was one of the biggest challenges of the film.[3] "It was the cast [in] which I [have] dreamed [of] since the beginning of the project," said Arnaiz.[3] "Both my producers in Mexico and the United States moved to get this great talent. They quickly fell in love [with the] story, characters, theme potential, and ambition brand internationally."[3] On 17 April 2013, actress Lisa Kudrow has joined the voice cast as Lucille in both English and Spanish versions.[27][28] She is the only non-Hispanic cast member.[27] To prepare her role, director Ricardo Arnaiz helped Kudrow with her emphasis in her Spanish for her lines.[29] Music[edit] The film's original score was composed by Leoncio Lara, whom he previously worked for films produced by Ánima Estudios.[30][31] Soundtrack[edit] The soundtrack features 12 original songs written and composed by various Latin artist, and three score pieces composed by Leoncio Lara Bon. The album features the song "Hasta el Cielo Alcanzar" (film's main song) written and performed by six-time Latin GRAMMY nominated Aleks Syntek. The album also contains songs by La Arrolladora Banda Limón, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, 3Ball Mty. featuring Don Cheto, Amanditita, Duelo, Horacio Palencia and many more. The Soundtrack is produced by Gerry Cardoso, Ricardo Arnaiz and Tomas Rubio.

Live Stadium 14 theater.[40] As of 2016, the film had been distributed in many countries throughout Central and South America, Europe, and Asia.[3] Most importantly, this is the first film to be supported by Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía (IMCINE) that originated from the state of Puebla.[3] "A project is supported by Fidecine and EFICINE when they see it consolidated, and with high expectations," said Arnaiz.[3] "Films like Don Gato or Una Película de Huevos have a great role in the box office and we also hope that this film [El Americano] can open doors for more animation support in Mexico."[3] However, the film only received a limited release, opening only in 160 theaters nationwide.[41] This was due to being distributed by an independent company, Never Landing Data Distribution, despite the film's immersive all-star cast, budget, and its first U.S.-Mexico co-production status.[42] "They wanted Edward [James Olmos] and choose Neverlanding Pictures S.A.P.I., Alejandro Sugich, a Mexican distributor of content and we released 160 copies, but we hope to do well to be in more rooms," Arnaiz said.[42] The film has faced numerous delays before its release; the film was originally intended for release September 2013 release, then a Summer 2014 release, and then a Summer 2015 release.[43][35] In Mexico, the film was released on January 22, 2016 in Digital 3D and 2D theaters.[3] Planned to open at about 1,200 theaters across the United States,[44][45] the film is now set to be released sometime in February 2016, distributed by Freestyle Releasing in the United States.[14][46] Immigration impact[edit] The film focuses on immigration, in which protagonist Cuco and his friends travel to the Mexico-United States border.[47] Edward James Olmos, the film's executive producer and voice of Gayo, found this film a perfect opportunity for thousands of Mexican children for them to know their roots.[47] "There are successful films that are very strong, but it goes straight to the hearts of children," said Olmos during a press conference in Mexico City, promoting the film.[47] "The policy of this film is beautiful! Ricardo Arnaiz is homered as ever! As Erik Estrada's character [said] in the film: 'You could fly nonstop, but they came here [to America]. What fun!'"[47] Olmos also hoped that this film could revisit the ongoing illegal immigration epidemic in the United States, and reform President Barack Obama to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants in the country.[47] RTC rating controversy[edit] Upon its theatrical release in Mexico, the Dirección General de Radio, Televisión y Cinematografía (RTC) has given the film a B rating due to the film's violence and "occasional" sexuality, which required ages 12 years or older (similar to the MPAA's PG-13 rating),[48] sparking controversy upon families and the filmmakers.[42] "The narrative can be complex; it presents some degree of violence, not extreme, for specific reasons and not related to sexuality, making clear [for] its consequences," said RTC.[42] "The nudes are brief and not [just] detailed and suggested sex scenes. You can address the issue of addiction and drugs, but without exhibiting their consumption. Verbal violence can not be extreme."[42] Reports asked director Ricardo Arnaiz about the film's rating issue, but didn't respond, though via his Twitter, he posted "Unfortunately, some people won't believe or want the film."[42] The film's B rating have concerned parents whether or not the film is appropriate for their children to see,[42] which could be result of the film's box-office failure.[49] Executive producer Edward James Olmos responded to the film's issue, saying that "El Americano is a film that children are going crazy to go see something wonderful that will represent Mexico and the world, showing the work, values and cultures of Mexicans with a family history."[42] After receiving complaints from social media, the RTC checked its database and confirmed the rating as an "error".[49] The RTC has changed the film's rating from B to AA, which allows the attendance of children ages 7 years and older.[50] "If there is an error, El Americano is rated AA, "Comprehensive for children under 7 years," the company posted via its Twitter.[51] Box office[edit] Although the film was projected to open at #2 place at the Mexican box office, the film bombed on its opening weekend, opening at #11 and grossing $1,248,994 pesos ($70,569 USD).[52] However, as an independently-released film, it is considered a moderate box-office success, releasing in only 129 locations, and topping other independent releases, such as Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet and Plastic.[52] Critical response[edit] The film has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 50% "Rotten" approval rating for critics, with an average score of 2/10.[53] Potential sequel[edit] Director Ricardo Arnaiz has expressed plans for a sequel, with the support of executive producer Edward James Olmos.[54] But they want the proceeding film to be successful and reach 200 copies by the film's second week in theaters.[54] References[edit] ^ "Leoncio Lara Bon".

Reception[edit] The series received a positive reception from many netizens for its innovative format. It was the first of its kind ever produced in MediaCorp history.[4] Its success led to the production of Blk 88, Singapore's first animated web series and i.Rock which stars Derrick Hoh, Keely Wee, Cavin Soh, Chen Yixi and Darren Lim. Notes[edit] The "PK" in the Chinese title (PK??) means "versus" in colloquial Mandarin Chinese. It was originally derived from the Cantonese profanity puk gaai (Chinese: ??). The term has entered common usage in China, Singapore and Malaysia and is no longer considered a profanity in those countries. In a local context, it means to go bankrupt or lose out in a deal.

In the 1870s, it was the strongest union in the United States.[1][2][3][4] It merged with two other iron and steel unions in 1876 to form the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers—the forerunner of the United Steelworkers.[1][2] Contents 1 Formation 2 Expansion 3 Merger 4 References Formation[edit] A puddler draining steel from a furnace to create a ball of molten iron, which he will carry to the rolling mill to be fabricated into useful steel items. Puddling is the process of stirring pig iron with iron bars, exposing it to the air so that the carbon in the pig iron is oxidized and burns off. This process creates steel.[5] As practiced in the early and mid-19th century, puddling required great strength as well as skill.[1] Because chemical testing of the molten iron had not yet been developed, puddlers relied on their long experience with steelmaking to determine whether too much or too little carbon had been oxidized.[1][5] Puddling was also an extremely dangerous trade, as some steel processes required the molten metal to boil and bubble as the puddler stirred in scrap iron and puddlers were required to physically remove slag and drain pure steel out of furnaces for additional processing.[1][5] The first strike in the iron and steel industry in the United States took place among puddlers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from December 20, 1849, to May 12, 1850.[6] The employers broke the strike by cutting wages and hiring new puddlers.[6] Labor relations in the iron and steel industry remained tense for much of the next decade.[6] Wages plunged during the Panic of 1857, and the steel industry was slow to recover.[6] On April 12, 1858, a group of puddlers met at a hotel bar on Diamond Street to form a labor union, which they called the "Iron City Forge of the Sons of Vulcan".[1][4][6] The new union resolved to commit itself to craft unionism, accepting only puddlers as members. Miles Humphreys was the new union's "Grand Master" (leader), and offices were established for a vice president ("Grand Vulcan") and secretary.[6] The new union did little for two years, fearing the blacklist.[6] The union's national leadership received no pay, but this changed in 1866 when the three national officers were paid the average industry wage in exchange for devoting full-time to union business.[6] Membership in the union was kept secret, for fear of labor spies and physical retaliation.[1] The Civil War led to a sharp increase in the demand for steel, and wages rose substantially.[6] Employers were loath to fire puddlers during the war because so few replacement workers could be found.[6] This led to renewed interest in the Sons of Vulcan, which expanded rapidly.[1][6] The locals formed a national union in Pittsburgh on September 8, 1862, calling itself the "Grand Forge of the United States, United Sons of Vulcan".[6] Expansion[edit] A second annual convention was held in Wheeling in the newly formed state of West Virginia in 1862, at which a constitution and bylaws were adopted.[6] As it became apparent in June 1864 that the Civil War might be coming to a close, employers attempted to cut wages.[6] The union responded with a nationwide strike of its members, which lasted eight months.[6] The strike ended on February 13, 1865, when the employers agreed to a wage scale based on the price of iron bars—the first time employers recognized the union, the first union contract in the iron and steel industry, and what may be the first union contract of any kind in the United States.[1][6] At the union's convention in Buffalo, New York which opened August 7, 1865, Humphreys reported that "forges" (as local unions of the organization were called) had been established in Illinois, Kentucky, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, and the union's membership had tripled.[1][4][6] The following year, the union began employing paid organizers across the East.[1][6] The union had 36 active forges and 1,514 members in 1867.[6] The union's strike policy, however, nearly proved its undoing. Initially, only the workers with a grievance would strike, with the majority of other workers in the refinery continuing to work.[6] Absent union solidarity, employers easily broke strikes.[6] Financial support for striking workers was provided by voluntary contributions from fellow "forge" members, not the national union.[6] This strike policy led to the collapse of 11 local unions in 1867 and 16 more in 1868.[6] The union counted only 600 members in 1868.[6] In 1870, the Sons of Vulcan instituted a new policy in which only the national union could approve a strike and all workers in a local "forge" were required to walk out if a strike was approved.[6] Additionally, the national union began providing limited financial support to strikers.[6] These changes significantly improved the union's stability, and membership climbed to 3,331 members in 83 "forges" in 12 states by 1873.[1][4][6] The union saw a membership decline of about 25 percent after the Panic of 1873.[6] Nonetheless, by 1876 the Sons of Vulcan was the strongest labor union in the U.S.[1] Merger[edit] Other iron and steel unions had also formed in the post-Civil War period, and in 1873 merger of the largest unions was proposed. The Associated Brotherhood of Iron and Steel Heaters, Rollers, and Roughers had formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1861.[1][4] This craft union recruited the skilled workers who rolled steel in railroad track mills, but soon expanded its membership to rollers throughout the iron and steel industry.[1][4] Another union, the Iron and Steel Roll Hands of the United States, formed in Chicago in 1870.[1][4] This union attracted anyone whom the Associated Brotherhood would not permit as a member.[1] The Roll Hands never achieved much membership growth, which led the union to propose merger as a way of combating employer resistance to unions.[1] The main impetus for merger was the growing failure of many strikes. If the puddlers struck, steel and iron already manufactured would continue to be milled by the rollers, heaters, roughers and other mill hands.[6] This enabled the employer to continue to manufacture product and receive revenue, and so outlast the union.[2][6] The movement to form an industrial union began in Columbus, Ohio, where locals of the Sons of Vulcan, Associated Brotherhood and Roll Hands amalgamated into a single union.[6] The National Labor Tribune, a newspaper dedicated to labor issues in the iron and steel industry, discussed industrial unionism extensively for the next year.[6] On December 10, 1874, locals of all three unions from Columbus, Louisville, Kentucky, and New Albany, Indiana, met in Louisville to formulate a proposal, which was published in the National Labor Tribune.[6] After three years of negotiation, the three unions merged to form the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers.[1] At its convention in Troy, New York, in 1874, the Sons of Vulcan debated the industrial union proposal, and reacted favorably to it.[6] However, the union took no formal action. The Roll Hands sent a representative to the Associated Brotherhood convention of July 1874 to negotiate a merger of the unions.[6] Merger was effected in Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 6, 1875.[6] The Sons of Vulcan, meeting at the same time in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, did not accept merger at that time.[6] The Sons of Vulcan replied on August 23, 1875, and informed the merging unions that they would participate.[6] The three unions met in Pittsburgh on December 7, 1875, and drafted a constitution and bylaws.[6] The three unions met separately in Emerald Hall in Pittsburgh on August 2, 1876, and adopted the resolution for amalgamation.[6] On August 3, the three unions as well as a fourth (the United Nailers) met to debate and adopt the new constitution.[6] The new Amalgamated Association was formed on August 4, 1876.[1][2][3][4][6] The Sons of Vulcan provided 85 percent of the new union's membership, and dominated the new organization for much of its early history.[1] Its membership was almost exclusive to the iron industry, as steelmaking was still in its infancy.[1] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w Brooks, Robert R.R.

Samuel S. Wilks
Samuel Stanley Wilks (June 17, 1906 – March 7, 1964) was an American mathematician and academic who played an important role in the development of mathematical statistics, especially in regard to practical applications.

Wilks Born (1906-06-17)June 17, 1906 Little Elm, Texas Died March 7, 1964(1964-03-07) (aged 57) Princeton, New Jersey Nationality American Fields Mathematical statistics Institutions Princeton University Alma mater University of Iowa Doctoral advisor Henry Louis Rietz Doctoral students Theodore Wilbur Anderson Wilfrid Dixon Ted Harris Donald A. S. Fraser Frederick Mosteller Known for Wilks's lambda distribution Samuel Stanley Wilks (June 17, 1906 – March 7, 1964) was an American mathematician and academic who played an important role in the development of mathematical statistics, especially in regard to practical applications. Born in Little Elm, Texas and raised on a farm, Wilks was educated at the University of Iowa, where he acquired his Ph.D. under Everett F. Lindquist; his thesis dealt with a problem of statistical measurement in education, and was published in the Journal of Educational Psychology. Wilks became an instructor in mathematics at Princeton University in 1933; in 1938 he assumed the editorship of the journal Annals of Mathematical Statistics in place of Harry C. Carver. Wilks assembled an advisory board for the journal that included major figures in statistics and probability, among them Ronald Fisher, Jerzy Neyman, and Egon Pearson. Wilks was named professor of mathematics and director of the Section of Mathematical Statistics at Princeton in 1944, and became chairman of the Division of Mathematics at the university in 1958. He was noted for his work on multivariate statistics. He also conducted work on unit-weighted regression, proving the idea that under a wide variety of common conditions, almost all set of weights will yield composites that are very highly correlated (Wilks, 1938), a result that has been dubbed Wilks's theorem (Ree, Carretta, & Earles, 1998). Another use of the phrase "Wilks' Theorem" occurs in the theory of likelihood ratio tests, where Wilks showed the distribution of log likelihood ratios is asymptotically ? 2 {\displaystyle \chi ^{2}} . From the start of his career, Wilks favored a strong focus on practical applications for the increasingly abstract field of mathematical statistics; he also influenced other researchers, notably John Tukey, in a similar direction. Drawing upon the background of his thesis, Wilks worked with the Educational Testing Service in developing the standardized tests like the SAT that have had a profound effect on American education. He also worked with Walter Shewhart on statistical applications in quality control in manufacturing. During World War II he was a consultant with the Office of Naval Research. Both during and after the War he had a profound impact on the application of statistical methods to all aspects of military planning. Wilks died in 1964 in Princeton. The American Statistical Association named its Wilks Memorial Award in his honor. Wilks's lambda distribution is a probability distribution related to two independent Wishart distributed variables. It is important in multivariate statistics and likelihood-ratio tests. References[edit] Mosteller, Frederick. "Samuel S. Wilks: Statesman of Statistics."

Louis Du Four de Longuerue
Louis Dufour de Longuerue (1652, Charleville-Mézières, Ardennes) – 22 November 1733), abbé of Sept-Fontaines (from 1674) and of Saint-Jean-du-Jard near Melun (from 1684), known simply as the abbé de Longuerue, was an antiquarian, a linguist and historian, a child prodigy who became the protégé of Fénelon; in his turn Longuerue encouraged the Abbé Alary and the young cartographer-to-be, Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville (1697–1782), perhaps the greatest geographical author of the eighteenth century. As a philologist, he remarked on the astonishing progress the French language had made, in its refinement and conscious purification from 1630 to 1670. The abbé was a free-thinker, for a man ostensibly of the cloth: Helvétius quoted[1] his remark that, if all the good and all the evil done in the name of religion were weighed together, the evil would preponderate.[2]

(February 2009) Louis Dufour de Longuerue (1652, Charleville-Mézières, Ardennes) – 22 November 1733), abbé of Sept-Fontaines (from 1674) and of Saint-Jean-du-Jard near Melun (from 1684), known simply as the abbé de Longuerue, was an antiquarian, a linguist and historian, a child prodigy who became the protégé of Fénelon; in his turn Longuerue encouraged the Abbé Alary and the young cartographer-to-be, Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville (1697–1782), perhaps the greatest geographical author of the eighteenth century. As a philologist, he remarked on the astonishing progress the French language had made, in its refinement and conscious purification from 1630 to 1670. The abbé was a free-thinker, for a man ostensibly of the cloth: Helvétius quoted[1] his remark that, if all the good and all the evil done in the name of religion were weighed together, the evil would preponderate.[2] His great work was his Description de France,[3] one of the secondary sources used by Edward Gibbon for his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Louis was born in Charleville-Mézières, the son of Pierre Dufour, seigneur de Longuevue et Goisel, a Gentilhomme de Normandie and governor of Charleville.[4] His elder brother, who had been expected to succeed to the title and was already a field marshal awarded the Order of St. Louis, was killed at the battle of Ramillies, 1706. After his death in Paris a volume of Longueruana was published,[5] based on the recollections of a devoted amanuensis who had transcribed Longuerue's savant conversations.[6] In 1769 a further selection of fugitive pieces from among his papers was published.[7] Notes[edit] ^ Helvétius, De L'esprit: Or, Essays on the Mind and Its Several Faculties, ch. xxiv "Of the means of perfecting morality". ^ Longuerue, Description de France i, 11. ^ In full, Description historique et géographique de la France ancienne et moderne. ^ Biographical details are from the Avertissement to Longueruana (Berlin, 1754). ^ Longueruana, ou recueil de pensées de discours et de conversations de feu M.

Belfast Confidential
Belfast Confidential is the seventh novel of the Dan Starkey series by Northern Irish author, Colin Bateman, released on 7 November 2005 through Headline Publishing Group.[1]
Belfast Confidential First edition Author Colin Bateman Country United Kingdom Language English Series Dan Starkey novels Genre Crime, Dark comedy Publisher Headline Publication date 7 November 2005 (2005-11-07) Media type Print (Hardcover) Pages 410 ISBN 978-0-7553-0925-2 OCLC 254860015 Dewey Decimal 823.914 LC Class PR6052.A773 Preceded by Driving Big Davie (2004) Followed by Nine Inches (2011) Belfast Confidential is the seventh novel of the Dan Starkey series by Northern Irish author, Colin Bateman, released on 7 November 2005 through Headline Publishing Group.[1] Contents 1 Plot 2 Reception 3 References 4 External links Plot[edit] The plot of the novel surrounds Dan Starkey and his recent appointment as the editor of Belfast's trendiest magazine, Belfast Confidential; described by Bateman as "a cross between Private Eye and Hello".[2] After the murder of his close friend Mark McBride, AKA "Mouse", Starkey is convinced by Mouse's Thai bride to take over the editorship and discover who was behind the murder. Starkey discovers that Mouse was working on a list of the 50 most powerful people in the area before his death and decides that those at the top are the most likely suspects. He sets out to discover if this is indeed the case. Reception[edit] Stuffed with bored ex-terrorists looking for kicks, and a suddenly booming economy, Belfast makes a great setting for a crime caper. “ ” Daily Mirror[3] The novel was well received by the media. In a review for the Daily Telegraph, Jake Kerridge stated that "the dialogue is extremely funny and Bateman obviously works hard on his easy-going prose". He further went on to state that he felt that "the wearyingly frenetic Brookmyre could learn something from Bateman's style".[4] The Daily Mirror also reviewed the novel and called the series as a whole "compelling and darkly humorous", stating (given this being the second Bateman release of 2005) "the bard of Belfast is on a roll". The reviewer did state that they felt that "the plot takes ages to get going", attributing this to "too much introspective loafing and lager drinking by sad Starkey". The reviewer did temper this somewhat, however, stating that "Colin Bateman is clearly the right man, in the right place at the right time".[3] Geoff, on-line reviewer for Opinionated Geek found that, as "it's written by a genuine Norn Ironer" it "gives it a bit more credibility". He goes on to state "And it's fun. It's a nice enough story that features the usual mix of intrigue, pain and hangovers". He further felt that "there's maybe a bit more depth here than in the earlier books, like Divorcing Jack, but it's still a fairly light read".[5] References[edit] ^ "Belfast Confidential (Book, 2005)".

Nguy?n Hu?
Nguy?n Hu? (Hán t?: ??), also known as Emperor Quang Trung the great (??) (born in Bình ??nh in 1753, died in Phú Xuân on 16 September 1792), was the second emperor of the Tây S?n dynasty of Vietnam, reigning from 1788 until 1792.[1] He was also one of the most successful military commanders in Vietnam's history,[2] though he was known to have attained these achievements by ruthless, massive killing of especially the entire Nguyen lords families and thousands of civil Chinese residing then in southern Vietnam, not his real enemy, the Qing dynasty of China.

House Tây S?n dynasty Signature Nguy?n Hu? (Hán t?: ??), also known as Emperor Quang Trung the great (??) (born in Bình ??nh in 1753, died in Phú Xuân on 16 September 1792), was the second emperor of the Tây S?n dynasty of Vietnam, reigning from 1788 until 1792.[1] He was also one of the most successful military commanders in Vietnam's history,[2] though he was known to have attained these achievements by ruthless, massive killing of especially the entire Nguyen lords families and thousands of civil Chinese residing then in southern Vietnam, not his real enemy, the Qing dynasty of China. Nguy?n Hu? and his brothers, together known as the Tây S?n brothers,[3] were the leaders of the famous Tây S?n rebellion. As rebels, they conquered Vietnam, overthrowing the imperial Later Lê dynasty and the two rival feudal houses of the Nguy?n in the south and the Tr?nh in the north. After several years of constant military campaigning and rule, Nguy?n Hu? died at the age of 40, possibly due to a stroke. Legend has it that he died actually because he was punished by spirits of dead Nguyen lords whose tombs he seriously insulted.[4] Prior to his death, he had made plans to continue his march southwards in order to destroy the army of Nguy?n Ánh, a surviving heir of the Nguy?n lords. Nguy?n Hu?'s death led to the downfall of the Tây S?n dynasty. His successors were unable to follow the plans he had made for ruling Vietnam. However, his conquests marked the beginning of approximately a century in which Vietnam was both unified and independent until the Western conquest of Vietnam in 1884.

An.[5][6][7] They left Ngh? An and moved to southern Vietnam after an attack by the Nguy?n lords against the Tr?nh lords in Ngh? An. His ancestors' surname was H? (?), but Hu?'s great grandfather H? Phi Long, who was a servant of the Dinh family of B?ng Chân hamlet, Tuy Vi?n district (or An Nh?n), Quy Nh?n province, married a woman from the Dinh family and had a son named H? Phi Ti?n, Hu?'s grandfather. H? Phi Ti?n did not continue farming as his father, but instead traded in betel. Through his work he met and married Nguy?n Th? ??ng, the only daughter of a rich betel tradesman residing in Tây S?n village. One of their children was Hu?'s father H? Phi Phúc (also known as Nguy?n Phi Phúc). Some sources say that in taking on the surname Nguy?n, the family followed the surname of Hu?'s mother; other sources say that it followed the surname of Nguy?n lords of southern Vietnam. Nguy?n Hu? was born in 1753 in Tây S?n village, Nghia Binh province (now Bình ??nh). He was the third of three brothers in a family with eight children. His father, Nguy?n Phi Phúc, made the three brothers dedicate themselves to their studies early in life. Their martial arts master was Tr??ng V?n Hi?n, a learned guest (môn khách) and friend of Tr??ng V?n H?nh, who in turn was the teacher of Nguy?n Phúc Luân, the father of Nguy?n Phúc Ánh (or Nguy?n Ánh). After Tr??ng V?n H?nh killed by Tr??ng Phúc Loan, Nguy?n Lord's uncle and a powerful chancellor, Tr??ng V?n Hi?n fled to Bình ??nh. He was first man to discover the talents of the Tây S?n brothers and to advise them to do great deeds. He is accounted for the prophecy "Tây kh?i ngh?a, B?c thu công" (Revolt in the West, success in the North). Seeking to overthrow the corrupted Tr??ng Phúc Loan and to help the prince Nguy?n Phúc D??ng, the eldest of the Tây S?n Brothers, Nguy?n Nh?c, gathered an army and revolted in 1771. He was aided by his brothers Nguy?n Hu? and Nguy?n L?. In the early days of the rebellion, Hu? was the most helpful of Nh?c's generals both in finance and in training the army; with the encouragement of Tr??ng V?n Hi?n and his own talent, Hu? rapidly increased his own popularity and that of the Tây S?n Rebellion. Quang Trung thông b?o, A coin issued during the reign of Emperor Quang Trung Due to its popularity, the Tây S?n army grew strong and attracted many talented generals, (such as Nguy?n Thung, Bùi Th? Xuân, Võ V?n D?ng, Võ ?ình Tú, Tr?n Quang Di?u, Tr??ng M? Ng?c, and Võ Xuân Hoài). The rebels became famous for their policy: "fair, no corruption, only looting the rich, and help the poor" (công b?ng, không tham nh?ng, và ch? c??p c?a c?a ng??i giàu, giúp ng??i nghèo).[8] The unification of Vi?t Nam[edit] Early time[edit] After 200 years of holding power in southern Vietnam, the government of the Nguy?n Lords had become progressively weaker, due to its poor leadership and internal contradictions. Following the death of Lord Nguy?n Phúc Khoát, the powerful official Tr??ng Phúc Loan began to arrogate to himself control over the Nguy?n government.[9][10] For the purpose of resisting against the excessive power of Tr??ng Phúc Loan and coming to the assistance of Prince Nguy?n Phúc D??ng, the Tây S?n Brothers gathered an army and revolted against the government of the Nguy?n Lords. The rebel army of the Tây S?n quickly occupied the central part of Nguy?n's territory covering from Quy Nh?n to Bình Thu?n, thereby weakening the authority of the Nguy?n government.[9][10] In 1774, the government of the Nguy?n lords sent a large army led by general T?ng Phúc Hi?p against the Tây S?n rebels. From Gia ??nh, the troops marched to northern central Vietnam, and after several battles they recaptured Bình Thu?n, Diên Khánh, and Bình Khang. The rebel army of the Tây S?n now only held the land from Phú Yên to Qu?ng Ngãi. Also in 1774, the ruler of northern Vietnam, Tr?nh Sâm, sent a massive army of 30,000 soldiers led by general Hoàng Ng? Phúc southwards with the same purpose as that of the Tây S?n rebel army, namely to help the Nguy?n Lords fight Tr??ng Phúc Loan. The northern troops were unobstructed in their march to Phú Xuân, the governmental capital of the Nguy?n Lords. The government of the Nguy?n Lords feared the beginning of an unmanageable war on two fronts.[9][10] Officials of the government arrested Tr??ng Phúc Loan and gave him up to the troops of the Tr?nh Lords. The Tr?nh lords, however, continued attacking Phú Xuân under the pretext of helping the Nguy?n Lords suppress the Tây S?n rebellion. The Nguy?n Lord Nguy?n Phúc Thu?n and his officials initially attempted to resist the attack, but ended up fleeing to Qu?ng Nam.[10] Seizing the opportunity, Nguy?n Nh?c led an army (with naval support from Chinese pirates) against Qu?ng Nam. Once again, the Nguy?n Lord Nguy?n Phúc Thu?n fled, this time by sea to Gia Dinh, accompanied by Nguy?n Phúc Ánh, and leaving behind his nephew Nguy?n Phúc D??ng.[9] Early in 1775, the army of the Tr?nh Lords marched on Qu?ng Nam at the same time as the Tây S?n troops reached Qu?ng Nam. Tây S?n troops searched for and then captured Nguy?n Phúc D??ng. The army of the Tr?nh Lords crossed the pass at Hai Van gorge, engaged the Tây S?n troops, and defeated them.[10] At the same time, the general of the Nguy?n lords T?ng Phúc Hi?p led his troops against Phú Yên, forcing the Tây S?n army to withdraw. Fearing a war on two fronts, Nguy?n Nh?c sent Hoàng Ng? Phúc a proposal that if the Tr?nh lords recognized the Tây S?n Rebel Army, the Tây S?n would help the Tr?nh lords fight against the Nguy?n Lords. The proposal was accepted, and Nguy?n Nh?c was made an official of the Tr?nh lords. Nhac also made peace with the Nguy?n lords, causing T?ng Phúc Hi?p to take off the pressure, and deluded Prince Nguy?n Phúc D??ng.[10] His diplomacy provisionally made Tây S?n's enemies inactive and bought him valuable time to shore up his army.[10] Tây S?n's counter-attack[edit] Realising that the provisional truce would not last long, Nguyen Nh?c retrained the rebel army, recruited new soldiers, fortified ?? Bàn castle, and built new bases, preparing for an attack.[9] T?ng Phúc Hi?p, who had been deceived by Nguy?n Nh?c peaceful overtures, did not pay much attention to Nh?c's activities. He did not prepare for either defending or attacking. Nh?c made use of Hi?p's inactivity, and sent troops led by his brother Nguy?n Hu? against him. The Tây S?n troops swiftly defeated the unprepared troops of the Nguy?n Lords and inflicted heavy losses upon them. T?ng Phúc Hi?p and his troops fled to Van Phong.[9] It was the first great victory achieved by Hu?. Nh?c sent news of the victory to Hoàng Ng? Phúc. On Phuc's request, the Trinh rewarded Nh?c with a new office. Because the troops of the Tr?nh Lords lacked familiarity with the southern country, Hoàng Ng? Phúc withdrew the troops to the north. En route, he died of natural causes. Phúc's death marked the end of the Tr?nh Lords' interventions in the south.[9] While the army of the Tr?nh Lords withdrew to Thu?n Hóa, Tây S?n moved quickly in sending its troops to take over the abandoned territory and to suppress elements loyal to the Nguy?n Lords. The consequent conquests[edit] Having gained a lot of new rich land without facing much opposition, the Tây S?n army grew stronger. Nh?c had a desire to expand Tây S?n's authority. He sent a large army led by his youngest brother Nguy?n L? to launch a sudden attack against Gia ??nh (now called Ho Chi Minh City) by sea. L?'s raid was successful: he occupied Sài Côn (hay Sài Gòn) and forced the Nguy?n Lord and his followers to flee to Biên Hòa. His success was short-lived, however, when an army loyal to the Nguy?n Lords and led by a man named ?? Thành Nhân rose against him in ?ông S?n. The loyalist army attacked and forced Tây S?n's troops to withdraw from Sài Côn. Before withdrawing, L? seized the local foodstores and took them back to Quy Nh?n.[10] Nguy?n Nh?c, due to his power, repaired to ?? Bàn city and in 1776 proclaimed himself King of Tây S?n (Vietnamese: Tây S?n V??ng), choosing ?? Bàn as his capital.[10] He gave Hu? the title Ph? Chính (Vice National Administrator)and later on B?c Bình V??ng (King of Northern Conquering). In 1777, Nguy?n Hu? led an army and successfully reoccupy Sài Côn, destroy Nguy?n lords' army. Most members of Nguy?n royal family died in this campaign, except Nguy?n Ánh, who find a refuge in Kingdom of Siam. Defeat of Siam (Thailand)[edit] Main article: Battle of R?ch G?m-Xoài Mút In 1784, urged by Nguy?n Ánh, the King of Siam send an army including two legions of infantry and navy marched into Southern Vi?t Nam, reaching somewhere which now is R?ch Giá. After some Tây S?n generals were defeated by the Siamese, Nguy?n Hu? himself led his armies against the invaders. At the battle of R?ch G?m - Xoài Mút, the Siamese were defeated and were forced to retreat back to their homeland. One of the secret weapons of the Tây S?n force was the H?a H? Th?n Công (Flaming Tiger Cannon), which could release a stream of fire at a very long range. Many Siamese wooden fleets were burnt by that siege weapon, reducing the Siamese navy's capability to carry out attacks against its enemies, Campaign against Tr?nh Lords[edit] In 1786, Nguy?n Hu? led his army to the north of Vi?t Nam with the cause of assisting the Lê dynasty and defeating Lord Tr?nh. The first battle between the two forces was the battle of Phú Xuân (modern Hu?), which the Tây S?n army won, allowing the Tây S?n to occupy Phú Xuân. After the occupation of Phú Xuân, Nguy?n Hu? easily captured Th?ng Long (modern Hà N?i) and other cities. Although he had not been proclaimed as an Emperor at all, Nguy?n Hu? was respected by citizens of Th?ng Long as the way an Emperor would be treated. Main events from 1786 to 1788 After the defeat of Lord Tr?nh in Th?ng Long, the leader of the Tây S?n, Nguy?n Nh?c ordered Nguy?n Hu? to bring his troops back to Phú Xuân. In 1787, Nguy?n Hu? led his army back to Phú Xuân (by then, Phú Xuân was the capital of Tây S?n). During 1787 to 1788, many serious events took place. The first event was that Emperor Lê Hi?n Tông of the Lê dynasty died. The succeeding emperor Lê Chiêu Th?ng had a plan to fight against Tây S?n. He reestablished the office of Lord Tr?nh and prepared his force for a battle against Tây S?n. The second serious event was that Lê Chiêu Th?ng called for help from Qing China in order to destroy the Tây S?n. The treaty between the Lê dynasty and the Qing led to the appearance of 290,000 Qing soldiers in Th?ng Long in 1788. Those events became the most dangerous challenges to Tây S?n. Defeat of the Qing dynasty[edit] Main article: Battle of Ng?c H?i-??ng ?a Late 18th-century painting depicting the Qianlong Emperor receiving Nguyen Quang-Hien, the peace envoy from Nguyen Hue in Beijing. The Qianlong Emperor of the Chinese Qing dynasty sent a massive army south with Lê Chiêu Th?ng (the last official Lê emperor) in 1788 to restore him to the throne, though under Qing protection. On December 22, 1788, Nguy?n Hu? erected an altar on a hill south of Phu Xuan and proclaimed himself Emperor Quang Trung, in effect abolishing the Lê dynasty.[11] He then raised an army and later gathered his forces in the countryside around Th?ng Long (today called Ha Noi) which had been taken by the Qing army. He declared in front of his soldiers: Fight to keep our hair long, Fight to keep our teeth black, Fight so that our enemies won't have a single wheel to come home Fight so that our enemies won't have a single armor to come home Fight so that history knows this heroic Southern country has its owners. In a brilliantly successful battle, Nguy?n Hu? made a surprise and fast attack against the Qing forces during T?t, the Vietnamese lunar new year holiday. This was traditionally a time of peace for all sides and the Qing troops were unprepared for battle. In a fierce 4-day battle they were soundly and stunningly defeated and Lê Chiêu Th?ng was forced to flee for his life back to China. Yet, Nguy?n Hu? showed considerable gallantry to the defeated Qing forces, allowing them to return home with honor and encouraging a peaceful relationship in keeping with previous arrangements, with the Qianlong Emperor. As for himself, Nguy?n Hu? had become the national savior of Vietnam and one of the most popular figure in the country. Rule[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (May 2009) Once in power, Emperor Quang Trung first began instituting massive and unprecedented national reforms in Vietnam. He set up a new system of administration and replaced the traditional Chinese script with the Vietnamese Ch? Nôm as the official written language of the country. His religious toleration won him the support of the growing Christian community and his campaign of the common people against the traditional elites won him the admiration of the peasant majority. He introduced the identity card system to govern the large population. Legacy[edit] Most cities in Vietnam, regardless of the political orientation of the government, have named major streets after him.[12] Nguy?n Hu?

Signorelli parapraxis
The Signorelli parapraxis represents the first and best known example of a parapraxis and its analysis in Freud's The Psychopathology of Everyday Life. The parapraxis centers on a word finding problem and the production of substitutes. Freud couldn't recall the name (Signorelli) of the painter of the Orvieto frescos and produced as substitutes the names of two painters Botticelli and Boltraffio. Freud's analysis shows what associative processes had linked Signorelli to Botticelli and Boltraffio. The analysis has been criticised by linguists and others.

(February 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Signorelli parapraxis represents the first and best known example of a parapraxis and its analysis in Freud's The Psychopathology of Everyday Life. The parapraxis centers on a word finding problem and the production of substitutes. Freud couldn't recall the name (Signorelli) of the painter of the Orvieto frescos and produced as substitutes the names of two painters Botticelli and Boltraffio. Freud's analysis shows what associative processes had linked Signorelli to Botticelli and Boltraffio. The analysis has been criticised by linguists and others. Contents 1 Botticelli - Boltraffio - Trafoi 2 Trafoi in Kraepelin's dream 3 Sebastiano Timpanaro 4 Swales' investigation 5 Freud neglected his own observation 6 See also 7 Sources 8 Further reading 9 External links Botticelli - Boltraffio - Trafoi[edit] One important ingredient in Freud's analysis was the North-Italian village Trafoi where he received the message of the suicide of one of his patients, struggling with sexual problems. Without Trafoi the substitute Boltraffio rhyming to it would be incomprehensible. Freud links Trafoi to the theme 'death and sexuality', a theme preceding the word finding problem in a conversation Freud had during a trip by train through Bosnia-Herzegowina. The second important ingredient in Freud's analysis is the extraction of an Italian word signor from the forgotten name Signorelli. Herr, the German counterpart of Signor, is then linked to Herzegowina and the word Herr occurring, as Freud tells us, in the conversation. Freud denies the relevance of the content of the frescos. Nevertheless, psychoanalysts have pursued their investigations particularly into this direction, finding however no new explanation of the parapraxis. Jacques Lacan suggested that the parapraxis may be an act of self-forgetting. Trafoi in Kraepelin's dream[edit] The first critique to Freud came from Emil Kraepelin, who in a postscript to his 1906 monograph on language disturbances in dreams, relates a dream involving Trafoi. The dream centers around a neologism Trafei, which Kraepelin links to Trafoi. The dream may be seen as an implicit critique on Freud's analysis. Italian trofei is associated to Trafei in the same way as Trafoi (cf. van Ooijen, 1996) and clarifies Kraepelin's dream. The meaning of trofei reads in German Siegeszeichen (victory-signs) and this German word together with Latin signum clearly links to Freud's first name (Engels, 2006, p. 22-24). Sebastiano Timpanaro[edit] In The Freudian Slip Sebastiano Timpanaro discusses Freud's analysis in chapter 6 "Love and Death at Orvieto." (p. 63-81). He in fact doubts, that the name Boltraffio would have played a major role during the parapraxis, as he states: "Boltraffio is a Schlimbesserung [that is a substitute worse than another substitute]" and adds "the correction goes astray because of incapacity to localize the fault."(p. 71). He calls Botticelli an "involuntary banalization" and Boltraffio "a semi-conscious disimproved correction."(p. 75). As to the Signor-element in Freud's analysis he puts: "The immediate equivalence Signore= Herr is one thing, the extraction of signor from Signorelli and of Her(r) from Herzegowina is another." Swales' investigation[edit] Peter Swales (2003) investigated the historical data and states that Freud probably visited an exposition of Italian masters in Bergamo mid-September 1898, showing paintings of Signorelli, Botticelli and Boltraffio one next to the other. In his view the paintings at the exposition were the source of the substitute names in the parapraxis. Swales dwells largely on the three paintings. The association of the name Boltraffio to the name Da Vinci, another hypothesis formulated by Swales (because Freud might have seen the statue of Boltraffio at the bottom of the Da Vinci monument on Piazza della Scala in Milan some days before his visit to Bergamo), is not further pursued by Swales. Although Freud visited Trafoi on the 8th of August 1898, Swales doubts whether Freud received a message on the suicide of one of his patients. Freud neglected his own observation[edit] Fresco of the Deeds of the Antichrist Freud in his analysis did not use the fact that he remembered very well a picture of the painter in the lower left corner of one of the frescos. The picture, sort of a signature, was thus a third substitute to the forgotten name Signorelli. The "signature" can be interpreted as a reference to the Latin verb signare and this word, instead of Freud's signore, then leads to a simple analysis of the Signorelli parapraxis (Engels, 2006, p. 66-69). There seems to be no more need for the Bosnia-Hercegovina associations (Bo and Herr) Freud himself introduced. In the alternative to Freud's analysis the suicide message in Trafoi remains an important point to understand the parapraxis (this message being a blow to Freud's self-esteem). The occurrence of the Signorelli parapraxis during Freud's trip from Ragusa to Trebinje (in Herzegowina) is not questioned, as was done by Swales.[citation needed] See also[edit] Dream speech Sources[edit] Engels, Huub (2006).

Ethiopia-Qatar relations Ethiopia Qatar Ethiopia–Qatar relations are foreign relations between Ethiopia and Qatar. As of 2008, neither country has resident embassies. Relations[edit] Ethiopia abruptly broke diplomatic ties with Qatar in April 2008, accusing "the output of its media outlets" of "direct and indirect assistance to terrorist organizations," according to an Ethiopian Foreign Ministry statement. The statement further alleged that "Qatar has left no stone unturned to cause harm to Ethiopia's national security".[1] In an interview with Committee to Protect Journalists that November, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wahid Belay said the statement referred to the Al-Jazeera news channel based in Qatar, which had aired a critical series on the plight of civilians in the Ogaden, a part of the Somali Region.[2] The Qatar Foreign Ministry responded with a statement in which they "expressed surprise" at Ethiopia's actions, denying the accusations, and "called on the Ethiopian Government to refrain from involving the State of Qatar in its rifts, recalling that the Ethiopian Government has previously made similar claims but the State of Qatar preferred not to reply out of the hope that the Ethiopian Government would stop such wrong behaviours."[3] Agreements[edit] In 2005, the countries signed a technical and economic cooperation agreement.

The Martin Luther King Memorial Bridge (formerly Cherry Street Bridge) is a double-leaf bascule bridge adjacent to downtown Toledo, Ohio, where Cherry Street crosses the Maumee River to become Main Street on the east side of the city. The structure opened to traffic in 1914. History[edit] In 2001 the bridge started what was to have been a $31 million USD refurbishment. This refurbishment widened the bridge's four lanes and added pedestrian walkways. The bridge's original control towers were replaced with new towers, modeled after the originals. When originally built, the streetcars operated by the Toledo Railways & Light Company shared the bridge with motor vehicles.[1] The technique employed to keep the streetcar's power wire taut when in use, yet allowing the bridge to be raised, was considered innovative and was copied in similar bridges.[2] The bridge's original deck was an open metal mesh.[3] The bridge was designed by Arnold W. Brunner and built by Osborn Engineering.[4][5][6][7] The bridge, including its approaches, is 1,100 feet (340 m) long. It is located a mile upstream from the Veterans' Glass City Skyway where Interstate 280 crosses the river.[8] References[edit] ^ Electric railway journal, Volume 42. McGraw Hill. 1913. p. 967.

Walker was educated at Steyning Grammar School and St John's College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. His earlier poems and later autobiographical work, in particular The High Path, show that his childhood appeared to have been unusually happy and totally remembered.[2] However, there was tragedy too: both of his paternal uncles, who lived in shared accommodation together with Walker's parents, grandparents and aunt, were killed in World War II; George in North Africa and Jack on Shoreham Beach.[3] At the age of 15 he met Lorna Benfell, and almost immediately after they finished college they were married (in 1956, at St Mary de Haura Church, Shoreham-by-Sea). At first they lived in west London and worked as teachers, she in Tottenham and he in Paddington and Southall. They had four children. It was at school that Walker and John Cotton, a like-minded colleague, founded a poetry magazine, Priapus, an attractive if amateur production, copies of which are now very rare.[4] Walker published some work in the early numbers, the beginning of his poetic career. Poetry and short stories[edit] In 1963 Walker obtained a teaching post in Bognor Regis and from there moved to Chichester High School. He had also started to write poetry regularly and of a quality that made it welcome in journals such as The Listener, The Observer, the Times Literary Supplement and the London Magazine. It drew the attention of William Plomer, then poetry editor at Jonathan Cape and a powerful figure in the poetry world. Walker had also submitted poems to The New Yorker, where Howard Moss made his work welcome. The fee which Walker received for his first poem to be published in The New Yorker, "Breakwaters" (published June 1963) helped him to move back to his native Sussex.[5] Looking for a new source of income, Walker taught himself the art of short story writing, and his first short story, "Estuary", appeared in The New Yorker in April 1964.[6][7] Other key influences on his literary development included the Welsh poet Leslie Norris[8] and canon of Chichester Cathedral, the Scotsman Andrew Young, both near neighbours, as well as the critic Robert Gittings. Walker's first book of verse, Fox on a Barn Door, focused on the Sussex countryside and coast. The titles of a good third of the poems - such as "Breakwaters", "The Skate Fishers" and "On the Sea Wall" are about the shoreline of Lancing and Shoreham. The South Downs likewise provided inspiration. Journalism and broadcasting[edit] In the 1970s Walker was a contributor to his local newspaper, The Chichester Observer, where his regular column on West Sussex villages fascinated (and often enraged) the county set.[citation needed] He also began broadcasting with BBC local radio and TV. In 1979 he worked on a TV dramatisation with BBC Bristol producer Colin Rose. It was the start of a productive relationship. Their output included Big Jim And The Figaro Club (1981) and A Family Man (1983). Big Jim, a series of comedy films set during the postwar building boom, extolled the comradeship which, for Walker, epitomised working-class life "in them far-off days of the Figaro Club before the world turned lax and sour".[9] A Family Man dealt with several generations of father-son relationships, drawing deeply on Walker's own family history.[9] Walker also wrote plays for Shaun McLaughlin in BBC radio drama and adapted Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows (1995) for TVC (Television Cartoons)' animated production with a voice cast including Alan Bennett, Rik Mayall, Michael Palin and Michael Gambon. Later life[edit] For most of his working life (1971–92) Walker earned a living as Professor of Creative Writing at New England College, an American liberal arts academy that had a British campus in West Sussex, while pursuing his writing and other great passion, travel. He was a frequent visitor to Spain, and in 1989 he published an account of his experiences and impressions of the country, In Spain. Although this was Walker's only significant venture into travel writing, it was greeted by critics as one of the finest portraits of the country. For example, Jan Morris listed it as one of her favourite books on Spain, describing it as "rich in details and sensations".[10] After a long hiatus Walker returned to poetry with Mangoes on the Moon (1999), with many poems inspired by his travels in Australia.[11] In 1987 Lorna Walker died after a long battle against cancer. A year later Walker married their close friend, Audrey Hicks, who had been similarly bereaved. In The Last of England Walker tells the moving story of Lorna’s disfiguring illness, and his own grief at being robbed of their anticipated years of retirement together. The cancer also serves as a metaphor for what Walker saw as the unrelenting decay of the England so lovingly described in The High Path.[12] In 1997 Ted and Audrey Walker moved to the village of Alcalali near Valencia, Spain, where he died in 2004. Honours[edit] Walker's early poetry won many prizes, including the Eric Gregory Award (1964) and the Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize. He was the first winner of the Cholmondeley Award (1966).[13] Walker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1975 (he resigned this title in 1997). Southampton University granted Walker an Honorary D.Litt in 1987.

You can help by adding to it. (October 2014) Held[edit] The court held that considering all the facts in the case, the exclusion clause was legally valid. On this, Henry J said '"...the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether it is fair and reasonable that the disclaimer should be conclusive: In favour of conclusiveness: 1. The transaction involved the sale of a business at the reasonably substantial ?gure of $385,000. 2. There was no disparity between the respective bargaining strengths of the parties. 3. Both parties were in receipt of competent legal advice at the time of critical negotiation. 4. The precise wording of special terms, included in which was the disclaimer, was the subject of detailed negotiation before being finalised. 5. The very schedule which comprises the misrepresentation was included as a warranted document in a draft of the agreement and was men deliberately and knowingly replaced by the monthly analysis of receipts. 6. Both [parties] were experienced in business and had taken the precaution of employing specialist accounting assistance before agreeing to purchase. 7. The disclaimer is not part of a standard form of agreement but is contained in the body of a clause specially drafted with particularity which carefully sets out the representations upon which the purchasers rely and expressly excludes all others. Against conclusiveness: 8. The purchasers in fact placed reliance on the accuracy of the monthly figures. 9. The hire component as a proportion of turnover was an aspect important to the purchasers. 10. The monthly ?gures bear a close relationship to material included in the contractual documents. Looked at overall, I have reached the conclusion that the balance is weighted, quite strongly, in favour of the vendor and that in all the circumstances the provision should be given effect and be conclusive as between the parties. The result of this is that the misrepresentation is of no effect and cannot afford the plaintiffs a ground for relief."'' References[edit] ^ Chetwin, Maree; Graw, Stephen; Tiong, Raymond (2006).

Founded in 2002 as a health organization, it has become eclectic, organizing projects depending on local needs. Over the years they have advocated the construction of a hospital (dedicated to Carlo Urbani), a children's Centre (Casa del Sorriso), a mass for the poor, vocational courses, microloans at zero interest, construction of houses for the homeless and renovation of dilapidated housing. It is currently operational in health and welfare, with projects in particular for underprivileged children and women in extreme poverty in Vietnam. The association works to help create a model of sustainable development, through the redistribution of wealth and the promotion of social equality. Enzo Falcone[edit] Enzo Falcone graduated in Medicine and Surgery cum laude at the University of Milan. He worked for Médecins Sans Frontières, the United Nations and UNICEF. In 1994, while working in northern Vietnam, he met his wife, Tam, who in 2002 founded Cura del Popolo. In 2009 for his contributions to Vietnam, he received Vietnamese citizenship under the name of Luu Hoa Binh, which in Vietnamese means peace. Philosophy[edit] The mission of Cura del Popolo is the reduction of poverty and its causes first. All programs of Cura del Popolo are long-term, brought forth by clubs and individuals who know the local situation, and aim to achieve economic self-reliance for recipients. Cura del Popolo is a small and flexible organization, which rejects government funds to act without suffering any political influence. The organization is financed through private donations. Current projects[edit] "Fammi andare a scuola"[edit] Support for the education of children and youth and their families, through grants and direct aid. Currently supports 140 children, supporting them throughout the duration of their course of studies, from primary school to university. "Casa del Sorriso 2"[edit] A home for children whose family situation does not permit inclusion in the project "Fammi andare a scuola". This project is designed to follow the children throughout the school growth path, supporting them even during their undergraduate studies. The "Casa del Sorriso" is a House like any other, and children living there are not provided just enough to survive, but everything a normal baby needs to be healthy and happy. All children are looked after by a local team that relies on the contributions of volunteers and experts. "Aiutiamoli ad Aiutarsi" ("Let us help you to help yourself")[edit] The project is directed to poor families who live in cities or in rural areas and is intended to offer an opportunity to work for families in difficulty, with the intent to make them able to support their own destiny, helping them to achieve self-employment through projects that generate income, allowing them to support themselves and their families.

Seth Lewelling
Seth Lewelling (1820 – February 21, 1896), alternatively spelled Luelling (including by Lewelling himself), was a pioneer orchardist from the U.S. state of Oregon, best known for developing the Bing cherry.[2] Born in 1820 in South Carolina[1] as Seth Luelling, he used that spelling of his last name for part of his life but at some point changed it to Lewelling and favored that spelling for the last several years of his life.

His brother Henderson Luelling (who retained the original spelling of his family's name throughout his life) came to Oregon from Iowa in 1847, bringing fruit trees in his wagon.[2] He established an orchard in Milwaukie, and Seth and their brother John came to Oregon and joined the business in 1847.[2] Seth became the sole owner of the business in 1857 and developed many new varieties of cherries, rhubarb, grapes, and golden prunes.[2] Among the cherries he developed were the Lincoln and the Black Republican.[2] As the names he gave to his cherries might indicate, Lewelling was also involved in the founding of the Oregon Republican Party.[2] In 1875, he developed the Bing cherry.[1] Lewelling was also involved in Oregon's movement for Initiative and Referendum.[3] He suffered a paralyzing stroke on July 1, 1895, and died at his home in Milwaukie on February 21, 1896.[1] Contents 1 Legacy 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Legacy[edit] Seth Lewelling is one of the 158 names of people important to Oregon's history that are painted in the House and Senate chambers of the Oregon State Capitol.[2] Lewelling's name is in the Senate chamber.

Mikhail Skobelev
Mikhail Dmitrievich Skobelev (Russian: ??????? ??????????? ?????????) (29 September [O.S. 17 September] 1843 – 7 July [O.S. 25 June] 1882) was a Russian general famous for his conquest of Central Asia and heroism during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. Dressed in white uniform and mounted on a white horse, and always in the thickest of the fray, he was known and adored by his soldiers as the "White General" (and by the Turks as the "White Pasha"). During a campaign in Khiva, his Turkmen opponents called him goz zanli or "Bloody Eyes". British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery wrote that Skobelev was the world's "ablest single commander" between 1870 and 1914 and called him a "skilful and inspiring" leader.[1]

After graduating from the General Staff Academy as a staff officer, he was sent to Turkestan in 1868 and, with the exception of an interval of two years, during which he was on the staff of the grand duke Michael in the Caucasus, remained in Central Asia until 1877. He commanded the advanced guard of General Lomakin's column from Kinderly Bay, in the Caspian Sea, to join General Verevkin, from Orenburg, in the expedition to the Khanate of Khiva in 1874, and, after great suffering on the desert march, took a prominent part in the capture of the Khivan capital. Dressed as a Turkoman, he intrepidly explored in a hostile country the route from Khiva to Igdy, and also the old riverbed of the Oxus. In 1875 he was given an important command in the expedition against the Khanate of Kokand under General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman, showing great capacity in the action of Makram, where he outmanoeuvered a greatly superior force and captured 58 guns, and in a brilliant night attack during the retreat from Andijan, when he routed a large force with a handful of cavalry. Later life, the Battle of Pleven, Geok Tepe and Death[edit] Skobelev in the battle of Shipka, Vasili Vereshchagin, 1883 He was promoted to major-general, decorated with the Order of St George, and appointed the first governor of the Ferghana Oblast. In the Turkish War of 1877 he seized the bridge over the Siret at Barbo?i (nowadays a neighborhood of Gala?i, where the Siret flows into the Danube) in April; in June they crossed the Danube with the 8th corps. Skobelev commanded the Caucasian Cossack Brigade in the attack of the Green Hills at the second battle of Pleven. An infantry division under Skobelev's command assailed the Grivitsa redoubt to the north. Schakofsky managed to take two redoubts, but by the end of the day the Ottoman forces succeeded in repulsing all the attacks and retaking lost ground. Russian losses amounted to 7,300, and the Ottomans' to 2,000. At the captured Lovetch on 3 September, the general distinguished himself again in desperate fighting on the Green Hills during the third battle of Pleven in which Skobelev took two southern redoubts. The Romanian 4th division led by General George Manu took the Grivitsa redoubt after four bloody assaults, personally assisted by Prince Carol. The next day the Turks retook the southern redoubts, but could not dislodge the Romanians, who repelled three counterattacks. From the beginning of September, Russian losses had amounted to roughly 20,000, while the Ottomans lost 5,000. The Skobelev Monument in Moscow Promoted to be a lieutenant-general, and given the command of the 16th Division, he took part in the investment of Pleven and also in the fight of 9 December, when Osman Pasha surrendered, with his army. In January 1878 he crossed the Balkans in a severe snowstorm defeating the Turks at Sheynovo, near Shipka capturing 36,000 men and 90 guns. Skobelev returned to Turkestan after the war, and in 1880 and 1881 further distinguished himself by retrieving the disasters inflicted by the Tekke Turkomans: following the Siege of Geoktepe, it was stormed, the general captured the fort. Around 8,000 Turkmen soldiers and civilians, including women and children were slaughtered in a bloodbath in their flight, along with an additional 6,500 who died inside the fortress. The Russians massacre included all Turkmen males in the fortress who had not escaped, but they spared some 5,000 women and children and freed 600 Persian slaves. The defeat at Geok Tepe and the following slaughter broke the Turkmen resistance and decided the fate of Transcaspia, which was annexed to the Russian Empire. The great slaughter proved too much to stomach reducing the Akhal-Tekke country to submission.[2][3] Skobelev was removed from his command because of the massacre. He was advancing on Ashkhabad and Kalat i-Nadiri when he was disavowed and recalled to Moscow. He was given the command at Minsk. The official reason for his transfer to Europe was to appease European public opinion over the slaughter at Geok Tepe. Some have suggested that he was suffering from delusions of grandeur and showing signs of political ambition.[4] In the last years of his life, Skobelev engaged actively in politics, supporting the ideas of Russian nationalism and militant Pan-Slavism.[5] He has also been credited as one of the earliest promoters of the concept "Russia for Russians".[6] At the beginning of 1882, he made speeches in Paris and in Moscow, predicting a desperate strife between Slavs and Germans.[7] He was at once recalled to St Petersburg. While he was staying at a Moscow hotel, on his way to his estate in the country, when he died suddenly of a heart attack on 7 July 1882.[8] In Russia he was a very popular man at the time of his death, and not surprisingly, his death aroused suspicion among many. After all, he was a relatively young (38) and vigorous man. Skobelev's early death deprived Russia of a great military leader.[9] This became especially evident during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. The Russian generals commanding in that war were men of Skobelev's generation, but none of them had his military genius or charisma. Skobelev In Memoriam[edit] After Skobelev's death, in Moscow a monument was raised in his honour on a major square on Tverskaya Street (across from the city hall, where today stands the statue of Yuri Dolgorukiy, the founder of Moscow), which was given his name, and the town of Fergana in Uzbekistan was renamed Skobelev. Today, his name still lives, even beyond the Russian Federation: shortly after the end of the Turkish War of 1877, the Bulgarians constructed a park in Pleven, Skobelev Park, on one of the hills where the major battles for the city took place. The park is also a location of the Panorama Pleven's Epopee 1877 memorial, where in one of the scenes of the gigantic 360 degree panoramic painting the White General is displayed charging with his horse and bare sword, leading the infantry Russian attack on the Turkish positions. Shortly after the entrance of the park, the bust of the famous general can be seen, watching over the city. The park contains memorials with the names of the Russian and Romanian soldiers that died for the liberation of Pleven, and is decorated with non-functional arms donated by Russia: cannons, cannonballs, gatling guns, rifles, and bayonets.

List of National Historic Landmarks in Idaho National Register of Historic Places listings in Idaho References[edit] ^ The latitude and longitude information provided in this table was derived originally from the National Register Information System, which has been found to be fairly accurate for about 99% of listings. For about 1% of NRIS original coordinates, experience has shown that one or both coordinates are typos or otherwise extremely far off; some corrections may have been made. A more subtle problem causes many locations to be off by up to 150 yards, depending on location in the country: most NRIS coordinates were derived from tracing out latitude and longitudes off of USGS topographical quadrant maps created under the North American Datum of 1927, which differs from the current, highly accurate WGS84 GPS system used by most on-line maps. Chicago is about right, but NRIS longitudes in Washington are higher by about 4.5 seconds, and are lower by about 2.0 seconds in Maine. Latitudes differ by about 1.0 second in Florida.

Mud Will Be Flung Tonight
Mud Will Be Flung Tonight is an album by the American singer and comedian Bette Midler. It is a live recording of one of Midler's stand-up comedy shows performed in 1985. Although primarily a spoken word album, Midler is accompanied onstage by her long-time musical collaborator Marc Shaiman on piano. The album captures Midler "throwing mud into the faces of some of your favorites", among them Madonna ("Like a virgin.....? Touched for the very first time....? For the very first time today!") Meryl Streep, Bruce Springsteen and Olivia Newton-John ("Let's get physical... let me hear your body talk..... My body said "Fuck you!!!") and it also includes the original version of the song "Otto Titsling", three years later re-recorded in the studio and prominently featured in the movie Beaches.

Marty McDonnell
Marty McDonnell (28 December 1920 – 22 December 2005) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He was born in New Zealand.

Marty McDonnell (28 December 1920 – 22 December 2005) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He was born in New Zealand. Recruited from West Footscray, McDonnell was a defender, used often at full-back. He was only a regular in the team after the war, having missed the entire 1942, 1943 and 1945 seasons due to service in the Pacific War. From 1947 to 1949, McDonnell missed just three games and he received the equal most votes by a Footscray player in the 1947 Brownlow Medal count. He represented the VFL eight times during his career. He retired after the 1950 season and applied for the job of Footscray coach but after missing out joined Yarrawonga and coached them until 1954. McDonnell was signed by South Fremantle as coach in 1960 and remained in that role for four years to mixed results: the club played finals for the first time in four seasons in 1960 and did so again in 1962, but in 1961 and 1963 the red and whites won just six matches in each season for last and second-last placings, so that his contract was not renewed after 1963 in favour of Ray Sorrell.

Jurgita Dronina and Olaf Kollmannsperger in Romeo and Juliet (2007) Jurgita Dronina (born 27 March 1986) is a Russian-Lithuanian ballet dancer. After a term with the Royal Swedish Ballet she joined the Dutch National Ballet in 2010 as a principal dancer. In June 2015 it was announced that Dronina would be joining the National Ballet of Canada as a principal dancer.[1] Early life[edit] Born in Saratov, Russia, Dronina moved to Lithuania when she was four. From 1996, she attended the ?iurlionis School of Art in Vilnius where she trained in ballet under Jolanta Vymeryt?. She then spent a year (2004–05) at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Munich studying under Konstanze Vernon.[2][3] Career[edit] In 2005, Dronina joined the Royal Swedish Ballet in Stockholm becoming a soloist in 2007. Leading roles included Nikiya in La Bayadère (2006) and Juliet in MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet (2007).[4] In 2009, when she was returning from Verona where she had danced Kitri in Don Quixote, she was invited at the last minute to perform Odette/Odile in Swan Lake as the scheduled performer was ill. She completed the assignment so successfully that she was promoted to principal dancer.[5] In 2010, after she had again performed the role of Kitri as a guest artist in Amsterdam, artistic director Ted Brandsen was so impressed he offered her a contract with the Dutch National Ballet. In 2011, she received the Dutch Zwaan (swan) award for her Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty. The same year, her performance with Cédric Ygnace in Balanchine's Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux was widely acclaimed.[3] Dronina has also performed as a guest artist with the Norwegian National Ballet (2009) and the Royal Danish Ballet (2010). In addition to numerous grants, she received first prize at the Grasse International Ballet Competition (2003), the Rotary International award (2008) and the Saint Petersburg award for Best Duet at the 2013 Dance Open Gala.[2][3] References[edit] ^ "New Principal Dancer: Jurgita Dronina".

De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars
De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars (pronounced [d? ?pœyno?p?(n) v?n ?xt ja?r ?pa?rs] ( listen), English: The Wreckage of Eight Purple Years) is a political non-fiction book released by the Dutch political commentator and aspiring lawmaker Pim Fortuyn in 2002, two months prior to his assassination. In the book, Fortuyn sharply criticizes the then ruling "Purple" coalition government and its direct predecessor (both composed of PvdA, VVD and D66) on nearly all areas of their policies.
De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars The book cover features a picture of Fortuyn saluting at a 2001 Livable Netherlands meeting,[1] along with a subtitle that promises to provide the reader with a "merciless analysis" of the public sector alongside recommendations on how to restore it to its former glory. Author Pim Fortuyn Cover artist Select Interface Country Netherlands Language Dutch Subject Various political issues, from healthcare reform to immigration policy. Genre Political non-fiction Publisher Karakter (Uithoorn), Speakers Academy (Rotterdam) Publication date de facto: March 12, 2002 (2002-03-12)[2] officially: March 14, 2002 (2002-03-14)[2] Pages 186 ISBN 90-6112-911-7 OCLC 783055562 LC Class JN5801 .F674 2002 De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars (pronounced [d? ?pœyno?p?(n) v?n ?xt ja?r ?pa?rs] ( listen), English: The Wreckage of Eight Purple Years) is a political non-fiction book released by the Dutch political commentator and aspiring lawmaker Pim Fortuyn in 2002, two months prior to his assassination. In the book, Fortuyn sharply criticizes the then ruling "Purple" coalition government and its direct predecessor (both composed of PvdA, VVD and D66) on nearly all areas of their policies. The book went on to become the first and only bestselling hit for Fortuyn, whose previous writing career had not yielded any great successes.[3] Puinhopen was reprinted more than nine times and eventually sold 270,000 copies by its tenth anniversary in 2012.[4] De puinhopen van acht jaar paars was branded by many Dutch media as well as Pim Fortuyn himself as the official election manifesto of the Pim Fortuyn List (of which Fortuyn was the founder and lijsttrekker),[5][6][7][8] but Fortuyn later retracted these claims.[9][10] Contents 1 History 2 Synopsis 3 Publication 3.1 Pieing incident 4 Reception 5 Political reaction 6 Legacy 7 References 8 External links History[edit] In August 2001, Pim Fortuyn declared he was going to enter national politics.[11] Although at that time he had not yet aligned himself with the recently founded Livable Netherlands, he did express his intention to release a book later on that year which would be titled Acht jaar wachtlijsten (Eight years of waiting lists) and would reflect on the two consecutive Purple administrations.[11][12] When Livable Netherlands asked him to be their lijsttrekker, Fortuyn declared that their electoral manifesto had to be in line with his upcoming book.[12] Acht jaar wachtlijsten was at first to be released by the formerly Marxist publisher Van Gennep, which had also published a previous work by Fortuyn.[13] However, Van Gennep parted ways with Fortuyn in November 2001 when the latter became close to confirmation as lijsttrekker of Livable Netherlands,[13] citing the incompatibility between their Marxist roots and the party's political positions.[13] Karakter B.V., an imprint of Uithoorn, was announced as taking over as publisher.[13] After Fortuyn and Livable Netherlands ended their cooperation,[14] Fortuyn founded his own party called the "Pim Fortuyn List".[15] Whenever he was asked what his new party's policies were going to be, Fortuyn generally referred to his soon to be published book by way of answer.[5][16][17] In February 2002, Fortuyn reported to de Volkskrant that this book was now to be called De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars.[18] On this occasion, he also said that his rationale for authoring it was the perceived laziness of the Dutch media. "As you may know, the press is too lazy to read anyway. So I have summarized my thirteen books in De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars," Fortuyn was quoted as saying.[18] Synopsis[edit] De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars is divided into ten chapters (including an epilogue).[19] Each of these chapters addresses one aspect of the Purple government's policies that,[19][20] in Fortuyn's view, required "unreserved criticism".[21] The chapters are titled politics (this chapter also serves as an introduction to the rest of the book), healthcare, education, security, restyling of the welfare state, agriculture and infrastructure, public government, immigration policy, and foreign affairs.[19] Publication[edit] Release of the book was planned for March 14, but it was accidentally available two days earlier because the publisher forgot to mention to the book shops that there was intended to be an embargo on selling it before that date.[22] In many stores, the book sold out on March 12, and the initial printing of 10,000 was already almost exhausted by March 13;[23] a second printing, again of 10,000 copies, had already been ordered one day prior.[22][24] Fortuyn's assassination on May 6 helped to augment the sales of Puinhopen even further.[25] Between May 6 and May 16, 2002, Karakter had to order three new printings together consisting of over 25,000 copies, bringing total circulation up until that point to 125,000.[25] The book went on to become one of the biggest commercial hits of the Dutch book trade in 2002, selling over 150,000 copies in the year of its release alone.[26] That year De puinhopen van acht jaar paars was the best-selling non-fiction book in the Netherlands, the third overall best-selling book (after Nicci French's Land of the Living and Donna Tartt's The Little Friend), and the best-selling book by a Dutch author.[26] Sales of De puinhopen van acht jaar paars fell off in the summer of 2002.[27] However, in May 2003, coinciding with the first commemoration of Fortuyn's death, Puinhopen saw a small sales figure jump, with book stores purchasing "hundreds" of copies to sell to their customers.[27] In the run-up to the tenth commemoration of Fortuyn's death in 2012, Karakter announced the total sales of Puinhopen to be 270,000.[4] On May 14 of that year, an e-book version of the book was released.[28][29] Pieing incident[edit] Fortuyn claimed he was able to share a laugh about the incident, but felt bruised in his integrity nonetheless.[10] On March 14, Fortuyn officially presented De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars in the political society Nieuwspoort (News gate) in The Hague. The event garnered massive press attendance as Fortuyn had become a major agenda setter.[30] During the conference, Fortuyn was pied by members of the Biologische bakkers Brigade (literally: "biological bakers' brigade"),[31] a radical left-wing movement who claimed that Fortuyn's "racism" should not be given "a voice", as well as wishing Fortuyn's party to receive "zero seats" in the upcoming elections. On her way out of Nieuwspoort, one of the perpetrators claimed she attacked Fortuyn with a pie because she felt what she referred to as Fortuyn's racism was not a matter of opinion, but should be treated as a felony.[10] After this incident, Fortuyn began expressing fear of being murdered.[32] After resumption of the event – when Fortuyn had washed the fecal matter of the pie off himself – he scolded prime minister Wim Kok for not protecting all of his citizens.[33] Fortuyn's supporters also blamed the attending journalists for not doing anything to stop the pie attacks.[34] Reception[edit] Job Frieszo of the television news program NOS Journaal reviewed the book on its release day, calling it "unusual" for an election manifesto to reflect the opinion of just one individual. Ideas like withdrawing from the Schengen Agreement were branded "unrealistic".[5] Current affairs show Nova / Den Haag Vandaag called it the "funniest election manifesto so far".[7] Hubert Smeets of NRC Handelsblad wrote a generally negative review of the book, in which he compared Fortuyn to a burglar and rejected his ideas as duplicitous.[35] "Things could get crowded with shopping carts and cardboard boxes in the hallways of the non-privatised railway stations or other indoor places", he concludes. Kees Lunshof of De Telegraaf was negative as well, claiming Puinhopen was "pubtalk", "nonsense" and "asocial", whereas Het Parool writer Kees Tamboer praised Fortuyn's plans for Dutch law on sick leave.[34] In an op-ed of May 2012, De Volkskrant columnist Martin Sommer dubbed Puinhopen "indeed an unusual pamphlet".[36] Citing Fortuyn's reference to his departed mother and his colorful language, Sommer saw a world of differences between it and election manifestos of, for instance, the CDA and PvdA parties.[36] Political reaction[edit] Political response to Puinhopen came immediately. On March 14, while the press conference on the book's release was still going on, members of the Socialist Party approached Fortuyn with a pamphlet containing their party's analysis of Fortuyn's views.[37] It was titled Leest u zijn boeken maar – de pimpelpaarse antwoorden van Pim Fortuyn (Just read his books – the deep purple responses from Pim Fortuyn) and concluded that Fortuyn embraced right-wing solutions to problems caused by right-wing politics.[17] According to the socialists, if Fortuyn's policies were adopted he would be even more purple than the Purple administrations themselves.[17] However, SP leader Jan Marijnissen also lambasted other political leaders who thought reading the book was not worth their time.[38] The lijsttrekker of the CDA, Jan Peter Balkenende, agreed with the SP's criticism that Fortuyn offered only purple solutions.[39] Balkenende was negative about Fortuyn's "return to the government" when looking for solutions, as well as his calls for ending the year-on-year increases in the respective healthcare and education budgets.[39] The reception of Puinhopen from the ruling PvdA and VVD parties was largely negative. Although prime minister Wim Kok considered Puinhopen to be "a good read", he criticized Fortuyn for penning "the most abhorrent accusations" against his administration.[40] According to Kok, Fortuyn's claims were "on the edge of being acceptable".[40] Ad Melkert, the lijsttrekker of the PvdA, stated that Fortuyn would make the Netherlands "less strong, and less social",[39] while VVD party leader and lijsttrekker Hans Dijkstal stated that he "held his breath" when reading the book, and lamented the absence of a paragraph stating the financial consequences of Fortuyn's ideas.[39] Legacy[edit] The title of the book (sometimes simply stated as De puinhopen van Paars) has gained widespread notoriety to depict the policies of the first and the second Kok cabinets in a negative way.[41][42][43] Occasionally the term has also been applied to the second Rutte cabinet at the start of the 2012-2017 legislature (particularly by Geert Wilders)[44][45][46] or as a synonym for Fortuyn's 2002 general election campaign.[47][48][49] On the last page of Puinhopen, Fortuyn promised a sequel, which he planned to release in four years' time, at the end of the next legislature, and in which he would dwell on the successes and failures of his parliamentary career.[50] This sequel never saw the light of day, because Fortuyn was shot and killed on May 6, 2002. On April 25 a group of Dutch comedians released a book parodying Puinhopen called De puinhopen van professor Pim Fortuyn (The Wreckage of Professor Pim Fortuyn).[51] According to its authors, the aim was to show the audience that everyone was able to write a book filled with "stupid plans".[51] Although initial sales of the parody book were good, 10,000 copies within the first few days of its release,[51] it was pulled off the market following Fortuyn's death.[52] Puinhopen also inspired Flemish N-VA politician Geert Bourgeois to write De puinhoop van paars-groen (The wreckage of purple-green) in late 2002, which – like Fortuyn's book, which attacked the current Dutch administration  – had been written to accuse the then current cabinet of Belgium of misgovernment. According to Bourgeois, the word puinhopen was the only justified term to summarize three years of Purple-Green.[53] References[edit] ^ Robin Utrecht (2001-11-25).

The milecastle itself has not been discovered by archaeologists and its presumed location lies beneath a modern housing development. Roman finds have been made in the area and the associated structure of Turret 7B is a significant surviving structure of the wall. Contents 1 Construction 2 Excavations and investigations 3 Associated Turrets 3.1 Turret 7A 3.2 Turret 7B 4 Monument records 5 References Construction[edit] Milecastle 7 has not been located. English Heritage currently lists it at a presumed location midway between Turret 6B (which was located in 1751) and Turret 7A (which has visible remains).[1] This location is covered by modern housing development.[1] Excavations and investigations[edit] A site investigation in 1928 failed to discover any trace of the milecastle.[1] Three stones have been found in the area of Milecastle 7 bearing the markings of the Legio II Augusta. Their style dates them to the late 2nd century AD, suggesting that the wall here was repaired around that date.[2] Associated Turrets[edit] Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 7 are known as Turret 7A and Turret 7B. Turret 7A[edit] Turret 7A is located in Denton Burn, in between Thorntree Drive and Brignall Gardens off the A186.[3] During the construction of a nearby house in 1923 a sestertius coin dating to the reign of Emperor Trajan was discovered.[3] Another coin was found in 1929.[3] Location: 54°58?55?N 1°40?57?W? / ?54.981843°N 1.682549°W? / 54.981843; -1.682549? (Turret 7A) Turret 7B[edit] Turret 7B (Denton Hall Turret or Denton Turret) is located in West Denton opposite East Denton Hall (also known as Bishops House) on West Road.[4] The turret is up to six courses high and is made from sandstone. It is recessed by 5 feet (1.5 m) into a section of the broad part of Hadrian's Wall that measures 65m long.[4] Turret 7B is 13 feet (4.0 m) wide north to south and 14 feet (4.3 m) east to west with a 3 feet 8 inches (1.12 m) wide entrance in its south side.[4] The wall associated with Turret 7B is the furthest east of the known surviving sections.[5] The interior of Turret 7B The turret was first located in 1928 and excavated by the Office of Works in 1929.[4] The excavation discovered a heap of pottery in the centre of the east wall, which has been suggested as the location of a window.[6] Three different levels of floor were found suggesting three stages of occupation of 122–196, 205–295 and 300–367 AD.[6][4] The original floor was constructed of clay and contained a hearth and a stone box, with a stone bowl on it, the floor had been partially repaired with flagstones. A spearhead and the binding from a shield were discovered within the repair.[6] A building had been constructed over the turret and 18th-century pottery remains associated with this were also found.[6] Another excavation was carried out in 1936.[4] It has been proposed that Turret 7B was one of the structures garrisoned by soldiers based at the Condercum fort in Benwell.[7] The turret was placed under English Heritage guardianship by 1971.[4] The turret and attached wall are maintained as a single property by English Heritage (known as "Denton Hall Turret"). The organisation operates the property as an open access site with no entrance fees.[8][9] Turret 7B was the first site on Hadrian's Wall visited in Guy de la Bédoyère's BBC Radio 4 series The Romans in Britain.[10] Location: 54°59?03?N 1°41?28?W? / ?54.984139°N 1.691234°W? / 54.984139; -1.691234?

Percha Dam State Park
Percha Dam State Park is a state park of New Mexico, United States, located 21 miles (34 km) south of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico on the Rio Grande.[1] The park itself encompasses approximately 80 acres (32 ha). The dam is less than 2 miles (3.2 km) downstream of the much larger Caballo Dam, and therefore Percha Dam's reservoir is essentially a wide, slow moving section of river. The dam's purpose is to raise the elevation of the Rio Grande slightly to allow irrigation of the chile pepper crop downstream.

Figurative palanquin
A figurative palanquin connected with the totem of its owner is a special kind of litter used in the Greater Accra Region in Ghana. These palanquins called in the Ga language okadi akpakai belong to the royal insignias and are used only by the Ga kings or mantsemei and their sub-chiefs when they are carried in public at durbars and festivals like Homowo. With these figurative palanquins the Ga create ethnic differences between themselves and their Akan neighbours that only use simple boat- or chair-shaped litters.[1]

With these figurative palanquins the Ga create ethnic differences between themselves and their Akan neighbours that only use simple boat- or chair-shaped litters.[1] Figurative palanquin; drawing by Ataa Oko from Ghana Contents 1 Significance of the figurative palanquins 2 History of the figurative palanquins 3 Users and manufacturers of figurative palanquins 4 Figurative coffins as ritual copies of palanquins 5 Figural palanquins and the Art Market 6 Kane Kwei, Ataa Oko and other figurative coffin and palanquin builders 7 References 8 External links 9 Further reading Significance of the figurative palanquins[edit] Figurative palanquin, drawing of Ataa Oko 2010 A Ga chief whose clan uses the lion as a totem must therefore use a litter in the form of a lion. The totems and family symbols of the Ga represent animals, plants or objects. All of them are associated with the history of the clan and his ancestors. When a chief is carried in such a figurative palanquin, using his totem symbol ensures protection by the spirits and the ancestors which are connected with the respective symbol. At the same time the totems magical powers are transferred to the chief who is sitting in the figurative palanquin. In contrast to the conventional boat- or chair-shaped Akan litters, the figurative palanquins of the Ga also function as marks of distinction between themselves and their Akan neighbours, and they even denote differences between the different Ga clans.[1] History of the figurative palanquins[edit] In precolonial times, the Ga did not use litters, but carried their Chiefs on human shoulders. The ethnologist Margaret Field believes that the boat-shaped Akan litters were introduced in Accra by the Akwamu living there since the 17th century. In the course of the 19th century, when the Ga took over from the Akwamu parts of their military organization, they also adopted the use of palanquins.[2] However, there are no exact sources describing when the Ga started to use palanquins in the form of their family symbols. The social anthropologist Regula Tschumi found only a short notice in the Gold Coast Independent 1925 indicating that the King of Accra, the so-called Ga mantse used an elephant shaped palanquin in those years. According to Regula Tschumi, the use of figurative palanquins spread in the course of the 20th century from Accra to other coastal towns where these palanquins, to some extent, are still used today.[1][1] Users and manufacturers of figurative palanquins[edit] Paa Joe with a sandal coffin for the Kunstmuseum Berne 2006 Unlike the Akan, the Ga use their palanquins only for secular sub-chiefs. Women and their highest spiritual leaders, the wulomei, do not use palanquins for different reasons. A palanquin is made new purposely for the enstoolment of a chief and is also used for the first time during his installation ceremony. After the installation the palanquin is kept as a royal insignia hidden away in the stool house of the respective family. It is not taken out again unless needed for an important occasion, such as the Homowo festival. Accordingly, the figurative palanquins of the Ga are very rarely shown in public and especially for foreigners they are difficult to see. Therefore, it is not surprising that although the palanquins look similar to the figurative coffins which are well known to the western art market, the figurative palanquins remained completely unknown until recently. These palanquins are also, contrary to what was believed formerly by many researchers and even many Ga, still used and built by the same craftsmen who make the figurative coffins. One of the most important palanquin builders of the last 30 years was Paa Joe who was known until now only for his figurative coffins. But as artisans are not supposed to talk about figurative palanquins and other royal insignias, Paa Joe is not giving out easily informations about the palanquins he had formerly built.[1] Figurative coffins as ritual copies of palanquins[edit] Ataa Oko with a battleship coffin made around1960 In the Ga culture, as Regula Tschumi has discovered during her fieldwork, initiations and funerals of the traditional chiefs must complement each other. Initiates must be buried in the same way as they were set up in office or initiated. Therefore, a chief who uses a figurative palanquin had and has to be buried in a coffin that looked the same as his previously used litter.[1] Contrary to what Thierry Secretan and others believed,[3] no king or chief was ever buried in his figurative palanquin, because litters belong to the royal insignia, which in the Ga culture may not be buried. Consequently, those chiefs who used a figurative palanquin at their installation ceremony had to be buried in a substitute, hence in a figurative coffin, that looked the same as their palanquin. The first figurative coffins therefore were simply copies of the palanquins which were used as a substitute. Though outwardly similar, figurative coffins and palanquins of course belong to a different category of objects: palanquins are royal insignia made to last and to be conserved in the family house after the death of their users, while the figurative coffins may be sacrificed and are buried with the deceased. The figurative palanquin become sacred after the death of their users and the family keep them in order to maintain contact with the ancestors. For the royal families they also become distinguishing marks and function as tokens of legitimacy of their rule.[1][1] Figural palanquins and the Art Market[edit] Ataa Okos called his coffins and palanquins simply "coffin-akpakai" or "coffin-palanquin". He made no difference between figurative coffins and palanquins. On the photo: Ataa Oko with the artisan Kudjoe Affutu, 2009 While the figurative coffins of the Ga became world-famous on the Western art market, the figurative palanquins remain up to the present hidden and unknown as an art form. It was long believed that the Ga would no longer use figurative litters and the old palanquins no longer exist because as Thierry Secretan wrote, the Chiefs allegedly would have been buried in them.[3] The fact that even many Ga still believe that their chiefs were formerly buried in figurative palanquins can, as Regula Tschumi writes it, be explained easily: Burials of initiates formerly involved human sacrifices and, to this day, neither uninitiated nor Christian Ga would want or be allowed to attend such funerals. Chiefs are also buried secretly, therefore it is and was difficult to say how a chief is buried when it occurs in the middle of the night. Hence, nobody outside the royal families noticed that their chiefs were interred in substitute palanquins. As a chief had to be buried the same way as he had been installed in office, it was imperative to bury him in a coffin that was the copy of his palanquin. The first figurative coffins used to bury the traditional chiefs, were therefore not a new invented art form but only the copies of the figurative palanquins.[1][4] Kane Kwei, Ataa Oko and other figurative coffin and palanquin builders[edit] The Christians and common Ga began to use figurative coffins around 1950 to 1960. As they were not allowed to use family symbols, which were still reserved for their traditional chiefs, carpenters such as Ataa Oko (1919-2012) and Kane Kwei (1925-1992) began to produce figurative coffins avoiding the traditional totem symbols. They built coffins which did not represent forms with a deeper significance, but rather objects which were associated with the deceased’s occupation. Today all the Ga, irrespective of their religious affiliation, use figurative coffins which were formerly reserved for the traditional kings, chiefs and priests. So these coffins are now used by the broader mass of Ga people. Since the 1970s, such coffins have been recognized by the Western art world as works of art in the Western sense. The exhibition “Les Magiciens de la terre” 1989 and the theories of Thierry Secretan[5] caused the Teshie carpenter Kane Kwei to be acclaimed as the inventor of figurative coffins and only his products to be classified as works of art. Through lack of knowledge, the Western art world erroneously attributed the invention of a supposedly new art form to a single artist and made him and the figurative coffins world-famous, while the significance of the already existing figurative palanquins remained until recently completely unknown. Therefore, in the West the figurative coffins acquired high artistic status which in fact would have belonged to the Ga original art form, the figurative palanquins.[1][4] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j Regula Tschumi: The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga.

John Hallett (South Australian politician)
John Hallett (30 August 1804 – 10 June 1868) was a businessman, pastoralist and politician in the early days of the Colony of South Australia.
John Hallett (30 August 1804 – 10 June 1868) was a businessman, pastoralist and politician in the early days of the Colony of South Australia. Contents 1 History 2 Politics and after 3 Recognition 4 Family 5 See also 6 References History[edit] John Hallett was born in Woodford in Essex. He and his family emigrated to South Australia on the Africaine, under Captain John Finlay Duff, arriving at Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island on 6 November 1836. Hallett, who was a business associate of Duff and both part-owners[1] of the ship, was one of those who remained on the island, at least in part to assist in a search party for group who on 1 November went ashore to hike along the north of the island, a trek that took much longer than anticipated.[2] Hallett and his family lived for a time on Kangaroo Island before moving to Glenelg. He and his wife were present at the Proclamation on 28 December 1836, and purchased a town acre at the first land sale on 27 March 1837. He set up a business with Duff as merchants, and on 28 March 1838, was one of a panel (with Rev. C. B. Howard, Rev. T. Q. Stow, J. B. Hack, E. Stephens and J. Morphett) appointed to develop an official policy on the treatment of Aborigines.[3] He built a substantial two-storey brick house on South Terrace, later occupied by Captain Charles Berkeley (–1856), Inspector of Police, and since demolished.[4] Politics and after[edit] He was a member for The Sturt in the South Australian House of Assembly from March 1857 to October 1862, having been narrowly reelected in 1860. His colleague in the first parliament was Thomas Reynolds and Joseph Peacock in the second. On 21 October 1862 parliament was prorogued, and the next day dissolved by proclamation. Hallett was a candidate at the ensuing election, but was beaten by R. B. Andrews. In August 1863 he was one of five candidates for three vacancies in the Legislative Council, but was unsuccessful. He withdrew from public affairs, and until his death lived in relative obscurity. Around 1860 he took up his residence at Ilfracombe, near Beaumont. In July 1863 his health deteriorated, and he transferred his business to his brother Alfred, and subsequently ventured to the city only once only once, in September, 1865. In 1868 he had three attacks of "serous apoplexy" (perhaps strokes), followed by bronchitis and died an hour or two before midnight, 10 June, surrounded by his family. At his request, the funeral and burial were private affairs, no public notice being issued. Recognition[edit] Hallett Cove (previously Hallett's Cove) was named for him.[1] The town of Hallett, South Australia was named for him, and laid out on his property "Willogoleechee".[5] Family[edit] John Hallett (30 August 1804 – ) married Maria King (c. 1808? check – she should be 10 years younger than John – 31 January 1891); they had five sons (three born in England) and five daughters: John Charles Hallett (c. 1832 – 31 October 1882) lived on Wakefield Street, Adelaide Richard Hallett (c. 1833 – 20 April 1882) lived at Wandillah Station, died of consumption. Henry Hallett (c. 1835 – 25 October 1911) married Martha Pike (10 June 1845 – 25 October 1926) on 24 July 1875. Henry was profoundly deaf. (Sara) Maria Hallett (7 January 1839 – 9 September 1907) married John Ogle Carlile (c. 1833 – 6 December 1912) of Mickolo, Western Plains on 5 January 1863 Emma Edmunds (Edmonds?) Hallett (13 October 1840 – 5 October 1909) married Dr. Francis Edward Goldsmith (17 October 1825 – 24 July 1875) on 13 December 1865, lived Magill, then Robe. He was appointed Surgeon and Protector of Aborigines in Northern Territory and promptly resigned.[6] A chronically paralysed invalid, he died after taking poison.[7] She married again, to Alexander Brodie ( – 25 November 1907) of Morphett Vale on 16 February 1883. 3rd Clara Selina Hallett (30 October 1842 – 17 June 1914) married (Thomas) Neville Wood (c. 1843 – 31 March 1907) of the South Australian Bank, Robe, on 15 January 1868 Julia Elizabeth Hallett (2 February 1845 – 1929) Jessie Brodie Hallett (17 March 1847 – 1916) married William Little ( – ) on 15 January 1877, lived at Terowie Edward Regia Hallett (6 April 1837 – 10 July 1909) married Victoria King (8 October 1839 – 5 May 1917 ) on 8 December 1863, lived at Winninnie then Kensington Alfred King Hallett (13 April 1849 – 19 July 1864) Albert Selby Hallett (23 February 1852 – ) Alfred Hallett (c.1814 – 3 November 1877) of Medindie, South Australia and Jesse Hallett (c. 1812 – 19 February 1859) and Selby Hallett (c. 1808 – 8 November 1862), both of London, were his brothers See also[edit] Hundred of Hallett References[edit] ^ a b "Nomenclature of South Australia".

Thomas Young (developer)
Thomas Young (c. 1650 - ) was an English woodcarver and property developer, best known for Kensington Square.
Thomas Young (c. 1650 - ) was an English woodcarver and property developer, best known for Kensington Square. It is thought that he was born in Devon. Young was apprenticed to a joiner and woodcarver, and was admitted to the Joiners' Company as a freeman in 1670, at the age of about 20.[1] In 1685, he acquired 14 acres of land in Kensington which he sought to develop, and as he later described it in 1701, "did sett out and appoint a considerable part thereof to be built into a large Square of large and substantial Houses fit for ye Habitacion of persons of good Worth and Quality, with Courts and Yards before and Gardens lying backwards". This was Kensington Square.[2][3] From 1692 onwards, the central garden was laid out.[4] Young attempted to develop Kensington Square alone, but had financial problems, which led him to sell plots to other developers, and to borrow more money. He was eventually jailed in the King's Bench Prison for debt. He was backed by Thomas Sutton, who persuaded him to give more equity to Sutton to prevent other creditors from seizing his remaining land, and to help obtain his release. However, after Young left prison, he was not able to repay his loan to Sutton, got into debt again, and spent almost ten years in Fleet Prison. He ended up having to bring a case against Sutton.[1] Young Street, which runs north-south from Kensington High Street to Kensington Square, is named after him.[2] References[edit] ^ a b Starren, Carolyn (2006).

Hitchiti
The Hitchiti were an indigenous tribe formerly residing chiefly in a town of the same name on the east bank of the Chattahoochee River, 4 miles below Chiaha, in western present-day Georgia. The natives possessed a narrow strip of good land bordering on the river. These people had a reputation of being honest and industrious.[1] Their autonym was possibly Atcik-hata, while the Coushatta knew them as the At-pasha-shliha, "mean people".[2]

The natives possessed a narrow strip of good land bordering on the river. These people had a reputation of being honest and industrious.[1] Their autonym was possibly Atcik-hata, while the Coushatta knew them as the At-pasha-shliha, "mean people".[2] Contents 1 Language 2 Location 3 Population 4 History 5 References Language[edit] The Hitchiti language, one of the many languages spoken by the Muscogee tribe, was spoken in Georgia and Florida during the Colonial Period by tribes including the Hitchiti, Chiaha, Oconee, Sawokli, Apalochicola, and Miccosukee. Based on the amount of places that have derived from the language, scholars believe it could have spread over a much larger area than Georgia and Florida during the colonial times.[3] It was part of the Muskogean language family; it is considered a dialect of the Mikasuki language with which it was mutually intelligible.[4] The Hitchiti and the Mikasuki tribes were both part of the loose Creek confederacy. The Mikasuki language was historically one of the major languages of the Seminole people and is still spoken by many Florida Seminoles and Miccosukees, but it is extinct among the Oklahoma Seminole. Like the Creeks, the Hitchiti had an ancient "female" dialect. The dialect was still remembered and sometimes spoken by the older people, which used to be the language of the males as well. Their language with the "female" dialect was also known as the ancient language.[5] Location[edit] The Hitchiti are often associated with a location in the present-day Chattahoochee County, but at an earlier period were on the lower course of the Ocmulgee River. Early English maps show their town on the site of the present-day Macon. After 1715 they moved to Henry County, Alabama, en route to their most well-known location of Chattahoochee. By 1839, they had all been relocated to Native American reservations in Oklahoma, where they gradually merged with the rest of the Native Americans of the Creek Confederacy.[6] Some of their villages were located at Hihnje, location unknown; Hitchitoochee, on the Flint River below its junction with Kinchafoonee Creek; and Tuttallosee, on a creek of the same name, 20 miles west from Hitchitoochee. Population[edit] The population of the Hitchiti is not known very well because it was usually recorded with those of the other confederate tribes, and only the males were usually recorded. In 1738 there were 60 males in the tribe; in 1750 only 15; 50 in 1760; 40 in 1761; 90 in 1772; and in 1832 the entire population, males and females, was estimated at about 381.[7] History[edit] For hundreds of years before white men came into Georgia, the Hitchiti Indians lived there. They were not nomadic, but they inhabited most of southern Georgia. Some records show they had traveled from the Great Lakes down to Georgia and developed a higher level of civilization doing so. The Hitchiti were part of the Creek Confederacy, which occupied almost two-thirds of the state of Georgia. Many Native American relics have been found in Jones County. The western boundary of the county is the Ocmulgee River, one of the favorite places of the Hitchiti tribe. Today one can find arrowheads and see numerous Indian trails there.[8] The tribe is not often mentioned in historical records. It was first recorded in 1733, when two of its delegates were noted as accompanying the Lower Creek chiefs to meet Governor James Oglethorpe at Savannah. When the U.S. Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins visited the Hitchiti in 1799, he recorded that they had spread out into two branch settlements. The Hitchitudshi, or Little Hitchiti, lived on both sides of Flint River below the junction of Kinchafoonee Creek, which passes through a county once named after it. The Tutalosi lived on a branch of Kinchafoonee Creek, 20 miles west of Hitchitudshi.[9] The language appears to have been used beyond the territorial limits of the tribe: it was spoken in the towns on the Chattahoochee River, such as Chiaha, Chiahudshi, Hitchiti, Oconee, Sawokli, Sawokliudshi, and Apalachicola, and in those on the Flint River, and also by the Miccosukee tribe of Florida. Traceable by local names in Hitchiti, the language was used by peoples over considerable portions of Georgia and Florida. Like Creek, this language has an archaic form called "women's talk," or female language. Scholars believe that the Yamasee also spoke Hitchiti, but the evidence is not conclusive. Other evidence points toward their speaking a different language, perhaps one related to Guale. The Creeks and Cherokee and Choctaw also are related to the band. The Hitchiti were absorbed into and became an integral part of the Creek Nation, though preserving to a large extent their own language and customs. Similarly, those Mikasuki-speakers who joined the Lower Creek migrations to Florida maintained their culture. For years they were considered to be part of the Seminole, which formed from remnant peoples in Florida. In the 20th century, they gained independent state recognition in 1957 and federal recognition in 1962 as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. Some sources list Hitchiti as an extant language in the 1990s.[10] The Native Americans of Georgia were all officially removed from the state and forcibly resettled in Oklahoma by 1839. This was when most of their culture and language left the state of Georgia.[11] To this day, you can still find remnants of the Hitchiti Indians all over the state of Georgia. A collection of Hitchiti artifacts was found in one location at a Hitchiti town. The collection includes a large copper disc at the center surrounded by Guntersville points, a variety of trade beads that indicate a heavy involvement in fur trade with the English, two ear plugs, five worked silver circles typical of the silver work of their decedents the Seminoles, a stone pendant, and a highly polished flaking tool.[12] References[edit] ^ Gatschet, Albert (1884).

Southwestern Bell Main Dial Building
The Southwestern Bell Telephone Company constructed a two-story building in 1924. The structure, which encompassed 18,726 square feet (1,739.7 m2), was to house the main dial equipment for the new automatic dial equipment that the company had introduced to Tulsa in November 1924. The architecture of the building was Gothic Style. In 1930, the company added four floors to the top of the 1924 structure to house its divisional offices and toll terminal equipment needed for the underground cable that connected Tulsa with Oklahoma City.

Timlin Architectural style Gothic Revival (Phase 1); Zig Zag Art Deco (Phase 2) NRHP Reference # 84003445 Added to NRHP June 22, 1984 The Southwestern Bell Telephone Company constructed a two-story building in 1924. The structure, which encompassed 18,726 square feet (1,739.7 m2), was to house the main dial equipment for the new automatic dial equipment that the company had introduced to Tulsa in November 1924. The architecture of the building was Gothic Style. In 1930, the company added four floors to the top of the 1924 structure to house its divisional offices and toll terminal equipment needed for the underground cable that connected Tulsa with Oklahoma City. The 1930 addition was constructed in Zig Zag Art Deco Style.[1] Contents 1 Building description 2 Addition to NRHP 3 Early history of telephone service in Tulsa 4 Notes 5 References Building description[edit] Southwestern Bell intended to build a two-story building to house its new automatic dial equipment in 1924. However, company engineers expected to add more stories in the future as the Tulsa telephone system expanded. They specified that the initial support structure be capable of carrying at least seven more stories.[2] The original two-story building was designed using Gothic Style architecture, which was then in vogue in the United States. The exterior was covered in light brown brick. The first floor has large arched windows framed with terra cotta. The color of the frames matches that of the quoins that reach to the top of the second floor. The second-floor windows are rectangular and separated by brick panels decorated with terra cotta torches. The second floor spandrels are made of buff-colored terra cotta tile.[2] Addition to NRHP[edit] Southwestern Bell Dial Telephone building was added to the National Register of Historic Places under criteria A and C on June 22, 1984. Its reference number is 84003445.[1] Early history of telephone service in Tulsa[edit] The U. S. Army installed the first telephone system in Indian Territory in 1879, between Fort Sill and Fort Reno, to support its operations to control the native tribes. By 1879, the Cherokee Nation installed the first commercial system in Indian Territory to connect the tribal offices in Talequah and Muskogee to the Five Civilized Tribes agency at Muskogee. This system also connected to Fort Gibson.[2] Robert H. Hall built a system in Tulsa that connected 80 subscribers in 1899. Hall sold his system in 1903 to the Vinita-based Indian Territory Telephone Company, which was bought by Pioneer Company on July 8, 1904. Pioneer is considered the forerunner of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company.[3] [a] Hall's business was a manually operated switchboard in an office on the second floor of a building at the northwest corner of First Street and Main. Lines to and from the switch board ran from the board through a window to a telephone pole outside the building.[3] After Pioneer bought the system, the main office and switchboard moved to the second floor of the Bynum Building at the northwest corner of Second Street and Main. By 1906, the Pioneer system served 280 telephones.[3] In 1924, Tulsans had 18,726 telephones, increasing to 41,471 by 1930.[2] Notes[edit] ^ The Arkansas Valley Telephone Company began connecting Oklahoma towns in 1897. Its name changed to the Pioneer Telephone Company in 1902,and to the Pioneer Telephone and Telegraph Companyin 1904. Pioneer controlled twenty-five Oklahoma exchanges after mergers with Shawnee's Long Distance Telephone Company and the North American Telephone and Telegraph Company of Muskogee, In 1905 Pioneer purchased the Missouri and Kansas Telephone Company and became part of the national Bell System.

The plot of Prison Break revolves around Lincoln Burrows' setup for the murder of the vice president's brother and his brother's plan to help him escape his death sentence. Lincoln's brother, Michael Scofield is portrayed by Wentworth Miller. In episode flashbacks, the teenage Lincoln is played by Max Kirsch, while a younger Michael is portrayed by Dylan Minnette. Lincoln Burrows was born in March 17, 1970. As one of the principal characters, Lincoln plays a prominent role in the series and appeared in every episode. The brothers' relationship is frequently explored in the series as their sacrifices for each other form a large part of the plot. In an interview, series creator Paul Scheuring commented that it was "extremely difficult" to cast the roles of Lincoln and Michael.[1] Dominic Purcell was cast for the role just three days before the start of production of the series pilot.[2] Contents 1 Background 2 Appearances 2.1 Season 1 2.2 Season 2 2.3 Season 3 2.4 Season 4 2.5 The Final Break 3 Personality 4 Concept and creation 5 Production details 6 References Background[edit] After their mother's falsified death, Lincoln became Michael's guardian. Lincoln dropped out of Morgan Park High School in Toledo, Ohio during his sophomore year and moved to Chicago to begin his life of crime. Prior to being convicted for the murder of the Vice President's brother, he had been convicted of theft, criminal damage to property, possession of drug paraphernalia, and battery.[3] He and Lisa Rix had a son together, Lincoln Burrows, Jr. (L.J.) (played by Marshall Allman). When Michael was 18, Lincoln borrowed $90,000 to pay for Michael's university education, telling him that it was his half of his mother's life insurance. There really was no life insurance and this money was the start of the events which ultimately led to Lincoln being sentenced to death. This was revealed in the flashback episode, "Brother's Keeper." Lincoln's actions instigates Michael's feeling of guilt and responsibility, which explains his reason for creating an elaborate plan to rescue his brother. Lincoln is accused of murdering the vice president's brother, Terrence Steadman. Although he pleaded not guilty at the trial, he was convicted on all counts and sentenced to death due to an overwhelming amount of evidence. After exhausting all of his appeals, his execution date was set for May 11, 2006. At the start of the show, he has only one month left. Appearances[edit] Season 1[edit] The character of Lincoln Burrows is first seen on newspaper articles in Michael Scofield's apartment. He makes his first real appearance later in the pilot episode when he is seen in the prison yard. It is established that Michael is his brother and a flashback sequence demonstrates the close bond of trust between them, as well as Michael's intention of breaking Lincoln out. After a surprise meeting with his brother inside the prison's chapel in the series pilot, Lincoln realizes that Michael is now an inmate. In the first two episodes, Lincoln's character and background is established, like his complicated and strained relationships with his teenage son L.J. and his ex-girlfriend Veronica Donovan. Particularly in the first few episodes, Lincoln warns Michael of the dangers in the prison and that he should be aware of his fellow inmates. As Michael begins to reveal his escape plan, Lincoln often takes a skeptical stance in the early episodes, trying to convince his brother of the futility in attempting escape and attempts to persuade Michael to abandon his plan, something he refuses to do. As the season progresses, Lincoln grows carefully hopeful of Michael's plan to help him escape. In episode "English, Fitz or Percy", Lincoln admits that he had resigned himself to his fate, but that Michael has given him his hope back. The next episode "Riots, Drills and the Devil" further explores the tight bond between the protagonists. As the season progresses, Lincoln's relationships with his son, L. J., and Veronica Donovan (played by Robin Tunney) grow stronger. L.J. slowly reconnects with his estranged father over several visits, while Veronica becomes convinced of his innocence and attempts to find evidence to exonerate him. Aside from scenes in visitation, Lincoln mostly appears in scenes with Michael in the chapel, with the rest of the escape team on PI or in his cell on death row, which coincidentally in real life, is the same cell that John Wayne Gacy was incarcerated in during his time at Joliet Prison.[4] From the eighth episode onwards, Lincoln and the rest of the escapees begin to dig a hole in the guard's break room. When L.J. is framed for murder by the conspiracy, Lincoln becomes worried and starts behaving irrationally, making him a liability to the escape plan. A secret message from L.J. in the episode "Tweener" manages to reassure him somewhat, however. In "Odd Man Out", Lincoln is forced to distract a guard to keep him from discovering the escape tunnel. Out of options, Lincoln punches the guard in the face and is sent to solitary. Despite this, Michael gets him transferred to the infirmary on the night on the escape for food poisoning. Lincoln is one of six inmates that are part of the failed escape attempt in "End of the Tunnel." When it fails, he resigns to his fate. The character plays a central role in "The Rat", in which Lincoln prepares himself for the upcoming execution. The viewers are shown that he goes through different emotions, ranging from anger to sadness to plain numbness, as he is finally strapped to the electric chair at the end of the episode. His execution is delayed at the last minute with the help of a mysterious man that Lincoln identifies as his father Aldo Burrows (played by Anthony Denison), despite not having seen him for thirty years. But when Lincoln tries to explain in "By the Skin and the Teeth" that he saw his father in the viewing room on the night of the execution, he is met with skepticism. In the following episodes, Lincoln spends most of his scenes locked up in solitary and plays only a minor role in the plot. In "The Key" Lincoln's prison transport is ambushed en route to seeing his son L.J. and he is almost murdered by Secret Service agent Paul Kellerman (played by Paul Adelstein), a member of the conspiracy. Lincoln is rescued by his father, who explains to him that the murder setup of Terrence Steadman may have been caused by his desolation of "The Company" after taking information with him about Steadman's company, Ecofield. Lincoln is re-captured soon afterwards. He is considered an attempted fugitive and returned to solitary, as nobody believes that there was an assassination attempt against him. He escapes successfully in "Go", and the first season finale finally sees Lincoln outside the prison walls with his brother. Season 2[edit] The character is featured more prominently in the second season than the first. He is featured mainly in scenes with his brother or the other escapees, and gets to take on a more active role than in the first season. Along with his brother and the other escapees in the season premiere, Lincoln successfully evades Brad Bellick (played by Wade Williams) and his guards. At the end of the episode he is heavily traumatized after talking with Veronica Donovan over the phone and hearing her getting executed by conspiracy agents. Outside the prison, Lincoln's first priority is to find his son, and the second episode “Otis” is dedicated to Michael and Lincoln’s failed attempt to rescue L.J. from the court house. After the failed impromptu prison-break, Lincoln has no choice but to accompany his brother on a journey to Utah to retrieve Charles Westmoreland's five million dollars. Lincoln's anxiety for L.J. causes conflicts with Michael, who wants to follow his plan. The next three episodes sees Michael and Lincoln reuniting with several members of the escape team. Together they find the site of the former silo and begins to dig for the money. In "Buried", Lincoln’s motivation to save his son is triggered again as he overhears on the news that L.J. is being released. Against Michael objections, Lincoln leaves the house at the end of the episode to find L.J., and the two characters have separate plotlines for the next few episodes. In the next episode "Dead Fall", Lincoln discovers that reuniting with L.J. might prove difficult, as he learns that he is monitored by agents of "The Company." Lincoln manages to provide a distraction and escape with his son. In “Unearthed”, Lincoln appears in scenes with L.J., providing character development and building up the relationship between them. At the end of the episode, they are identified and arrested by the police. It is Lincoln's father Aldo that comes to his son's rescue, sending men to secure Lincoln and L.J. This begins Lincoln’s more direct involvement of the conspiracy plotline of the show, as his father outlines his plan to bring down The Company once and for all. In "Disconnect", the two characters meet with Michael. Aldo is later killed by F.B.I. agent Alexander Mahone (played by William Fichtner), which prompts Michael and Lincoln to stop running and to find evidence to expose "The Company" by searching for Sara Tancredi (played by Sarah Wayne Callies). In "The Killing Box", Michael and Lincoln are taken into custody by the Border Patrol. On route back to Fox River, operatives of The Company helps them escape from the prison transport van in hopes of eliminating the brothers once and for all. The protagonists escape this death trap at the last minute, when they are aided by Paul Kellerman, who in an act of self-preservation, turns against "The Company." At the end of the fall final, the brothers have no choice but to go along with their new uneasy ally. In "John Doe" Lincoln comes face to face with Terrence Steadman, the man he was convicted of murdering. Steadman commits suicide and forces Lincoln and Michael to look for an alternative way to prove Lincoln's innocence. Lincoln, Michael and Kellerman find Sara and together, they head back to Chicago, where Sara's father, Frank Tancredi (played by John Heard), had hidden the USB drive which holds a recorded conversation between Caroline Reynolds and Terrence Steadman after his supposed death date. When the tape proves to be useless as evidence, Lincoln and Michael attempt to blackmail President Caroline Reynolds (played by Patricia Wettig). When this also fails, Lincoln and Michael are forced to leave the country. In Sona Lincoln's exoneration finally comes through when Paul Kellerman decides to testify against "The Company." This makes Lincoln one of the two Fox River Eight members who have successfully evaded capture by the authorities. The brothers' joy is short-lived when Company executive Bill Kim (played by Reggie Lee) tracks them down in Panama and has orders to kill "one of them." Sara shoots Kim, allowing them to escape. As the police draw near, Lincoln, Michael and Sara flee from the scene but are separated in the process. Michael takes the blame for Kim's death and is sent to the Panamanian prison Sona. Ignorant of his brother's recapture, Lincoln searches for Michael and Sara in the season finale before spotting Sara traveling alone. In his last scene of the season, Lincoln tries to get her attention but loses her in the crowd. Season 3[edit] Lincoln uses his free status to try to help Michael get out of Sona Prison. He manages to get the consul to transfer Michael to a cleaner and safer prison. While explaining the situation, Michael instructed him to find Sara. The local authorities believe they've found Sara's body, which turned out not to be her. Lincoln is then called by his son LJ and is instructed to meet him and Sara at a bar, but instead he encounters a stranger calling herself Susan B. Anthony (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), who lets Lincoln know that Sara and LJ have been kidnapped and will be killed if Michael doesn't break out a man imprisoned in Sona named James Whistler. As Michael plots his escape, Lincoln does some sleuthing of his own on the outside: he follows Whistler's girlfriend Sofia Lugo and manages to acquire an ornithology guide with Whistler's notes in it. As Michael begins to have doubts, Lincoln takes matters into his own hands, tracking down Sara and LJ and knocking out two Company agents before the other agents escape with their hostages. Following his failed attempt, Lincoln receives what he believed to be Sara's head in a box. He decides not to tell Michael, who instructs Lincoln to recruit the grave digger. Lincoln is also forced to hand the real bird book to Susan. At the same time, Fernando Sucre and Sofia Lugo offer their assistance. Lincoln goes about procuring a getaway vehicle. After finding the roads are heavily guarded, Linc buys some supplies at a dive shop, and then goes with Sofia to the beach, not far from the prison, where he buries them. Susan's threat of killing LJ forced Lincoln to back down and follow her orders, instead of trying to outsmart her. The next two episodes follow the escape plan and after the escape ultimately fails, Lincoln engages in a tense standoff with Susan to rescue L.J. but Lincoln is forced to back down again. Susan, while planning for the Bang and Burn operation, then sent Company agents to eliminate Sofia, Sucre and him but this ultimately fails. When the operation fails, Susan decided to try to get Lincoln back into the plan by letting him see LJ. While figuring out the escape plan, Lincoln goes about buying a bomb to plan an explosive finish for Susan and tried to use Sucre to trick her, but both attempts ultimately fail. Sucre and Maricruz were also implicated as a result, though without Lincoln's knowing. Later on, Susan used Sofia as a hostage. That night, Lincoln steals a bus to knock out the power lines to Sona Prison, which then starts off the escape of Michael and the other inmates inside Sona Prison. The escape is eventually successful, with Lincoln joining the inmates and McGrady parting off with his dad in separate ways. Whistler later tried to escape, but Lincoln managed to get hold of him, forcing Gretchen to carry out the hostage exchange successfully at a museum. Later on, Gretchen's men open fire on police, so that Gretchen and Whistler could escape unharmed but the firing caused Sofia to be shot. In the season finale, Lincoln, LJ and Sofia were last seen at the hospital, where LJ is tending to Sofia's wounds. Season 4[edit] Lincoln is first seen with LJ and Sofia in a restaurant in Panama. When a confused Michael calls him and asks if he is sure that he saw Sara's head in the box, he says he did. Lincoln is later attacked by a Company agent, Lincoln kills him, which leads him to being arrested and extradited. When brought to America and reunited with Michael. They meet Donald Self, a homeland security agent, who gives him along with Michael, Sucre, Mahone, and Bellick two choices: either go back to jail or bring down The Company. When Lincoln is first put with the other convicts, Michael, Sara, Bellick, Sucre, Roland and Mahone he isn't happy to be stuck with the bunch only caring for his younger brother and Sara and having some good feelings towards Sucre. He and Bellick rarely exchange words but Roland often gets on his nerves and he doesn't like the kid, only putting up with him because he's the computer nerd and without him the cons could only do half a job. Mahone is a different story, he swears revenge of his father's death once they fulfill Self's mission. When Lincoln overhears a phone call in which Mahone tells Lang the company killed his son Lincoln relates to the man (the company tried to kill LJ previously) and promises Mahone that after the mission, together they would track down the person(s) who killed Cameron. Lincoln forms a fondness for Mahone and realizes the two aren't as different as he initially thought and although he can't forgive the other man for killing his father he has grown sympathetic towards him. He also has a good relationship with Bellick eventually because Bellick on several occasions saved his life, like in "Eagles and Angels" when Bellick distracts a Company goon about to kill Lincoln. In the episode "Quiet Riot", along with Michael, Sucre, and Mahone, Lincoln enters through the company HQ and reaches to the actual Scylla machine. In episode "Selfless" they are caught by the General and his goons, although that was the plan. The goons are about to shoot Michael, although they are held at gunpoint by Mahone and Sucre. Lincoln holds the General at gunpoint. The General is forced to give up his card, which he thinks is useless, although he is shocked when Michael shows him the other 5 Scylla cards. They take him hostage and later escape with Scylla, though they are betrayed by Self at the end of the episode. In the episode "Deal Or No Deal" Lincoln is captured by homeland security agents and agrees to testify against Self for immunity. Michael comes in and they are about to be killed by the Homeland Security agents, until a Company agent saves them by murdering the Homeland Security agents and is about to bring Michael and Lincoln to the General. Sucre sneaks up behind the agent and points the gun at the him and Lincoln takes the agent's weapon and kills him. In "Just Business", he is worried about Michael's health as they keep trying to get Scylla back. Lincoln uses a rocket launcher to blast Self's hotel window. He runs to the alleyway, seeing Michael with a bloody nose and unconscious, picked up and thrown in a Company van. He goes to confront the General face to face and says he'll do anything to save Michael, even getting Scylla back to The Company. Lincoln tells Michael that he discovered that their mother had also worked for The Company and that he is going to get Scylla back for them to save Michael's life. In the following episodes, Lincoln works on getting Scylla back, and is assigned a team by the general, consisting of Self, Gretchen and T-Bag. They are later joined by Mahone. When the general is displeased at their lack of progress, he sends photos of their loved ones, threatening to hurt them if the team does not find Scylla. Lincoln is also opposed by Michael, who seeks to find Scylla first and bring down The Company. The protagonists also learn that their mother, Christina Rose Scofield, is alive and that she is the one in possession of Scylla. In the episode “SOB”, Lincoln is framed by Christina for the murder of a high-ranking Indian official. Michael puts their differences aside, however, and rescues Lincoln. They escape from the police in “Cowboys and Indians”, and manages to steal Scylla from Christina. She responds by capturing Lincoln and shooting him in the lung, telling Michael that Lincoln will die if he doesn’t return Scylla to her. The episode ends with Michael having to decide between saving Sara or Linc. In the next episode he decides to save them both, and sends Mahone with an explosive device to kill Christina and rescue Lincoln while Michael saves Sara. The plan is successful. After they are unexpectedly contacted by Kellerman, he offers them complete exoneration if they hand over Scylla to a contact who is a member of the United Nations, which they do and are all exonerated. Following their exoneration, Michael’s nose begins to bleed, indicating that the tumor which was treated earlier in the series is back. In the series epilogue set 4 years later, Lincoln owns a scuba shop with Sofia. In his very last scene, Lincoln puts an origami crane on Michael's gravestone and walks off into the sunset with Mahone, Sucre, Michael's son (who is Lincoln's nephew), and Sara. The Final Break[edit] After hearing of the bounty on Sara's head in prison, Lincoln agrees to help Michael break her out. Lincoln, with Sucre, scope out the prison, taking measurements and photographs to create a map of the prison. Lincoln later goes to the men's prison attached to where Sara is, and attempts to convince T-Bag to set a fire at 7pm. T-Bag requests $100,000 to set the fire and instructs Lincoln who to steal the money from and how to get it, which he eventually steals for himself. At the end of the movie, Lincoln is shown on a boat moving to the Dominican Republic. Personality[edit] In the first two seasons Lincoln is revealed as very strong, both physically and mentally, and he shows himself as very threatening (to the point of fighting five of T-Bag's men single handedly to defend a CO during a riot) and intimidating. Despite that, he is revealed as unable to kill. After mastering Mahone in the episode "Fin Del Camino", his hesitation to shoot him allows Mahone to regain the advantage and master him, causing him to tell Michael, "Deep down, he's just like you. He has a heart that can't kill a man." In season three, Lincoln kills for the first time, shooting one of the Company operatives and appearing to have no remorse. In season four, Lincoln Burrows appears to have grown ruthless and cruel, acting just like a company agent (including the suit and gun), not hesitating to fire his gun and willing to torture people (seen when he rips out T-Bag's teeth). After the Company is taken down once and for all, Lincoln reverts to his original self, no longer a killer, but a family man once again. Concept and creation[edit] Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast.[5] He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set on the first day of filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.[6] Production details[edit] Paul Adelstein, who plays Lincoln's nemesis for the first 35 episodes as Paul Kellerman, originally auditioned for the role of Lincoln. Johnny Messner and Eric Dane were joint choices for the role but executives couldn't decide who to go with so they searched for someone else resulting in Dominic Purcell's casting.

It is the world's longest single-span bridge dedicated exclusively to carrying pedestrians and cyclists. Its overall length is 248 metres (813 ft 8 in) and its main span is 229.4 metres (752 ft 7 in).[1] Its name comes from the bridge's location between France, Germany and Switzerland (which is about 200 metres (660 ft) distant). It was designed by the Franco-Austrian architect Dietmar Feichtinger. Contents 1 Location 2 Construction 3 Sources 4 References 5 External links Location[edit] The first crossing at this place was built for Huningue Castle and was destroyed by French troops in 1797. The Three Countries Bridge is located at the exact spot where, on 20 October 1944, the Huningue pontoon bridge was destroyed by Allied incendiary bombs. From then until the opening of Palmrainbrücke for road vehicles in 1979, the German federal highway number 532 ended at this point with a car ferry crossing. So as not to block the view from Place Abbatucci (Huningue central square) along the Rue de France and across the river to Weil-am-Rhein Hauptsrasse on the opposite side (and vice versa); the bridge is built just north of the line of these roads. Construction[edit] The bridge is an arch bridge with a centre lane, and at 229 metres (751 ft) is the world's longest span pedestrian bridge. Its total length is 248 metres (814 ft) with no vehicle access ramps. The arch rise measures only 20 metres (66 ft), and the highest point is about 25 metres (82 ft) above the water, with the bridge deck about 14 metres (46 ft) below the arch crown. Seen in cross-section, the supporting structure is asymmetric. On the up-river side it is a hexagonal cross-section of sheet steel, and downstream are two others; the first is more inclined to the inside and the latter two are bearing the brunt of the load. The building was designed by architect Dietmar Feichtinger, in collaboration with the Büro LAP Leonhardt Andra & Partner (Berlin / Stuttgart). The construction of the bridge required 1,012 tonnes (996 long tons; 1,116 short tons) of steel, 1,798 cubic metres (63,500 cu ft) of concrete, and 805 metres (2,641 ft) of cables of 30 and 60 centimetres (12 and 24 in) in diameter. The construction cost was nine million euros, which were funded by grants from the European Union, the State of Baden-Württemberg, the Haut-Rhin département, and the two neighbouring communities. The bridge was assembled nearby in Huningue, then transported on 26 November 2006 to its current site on the Rhine. The bridge opened to the public on 30 March 2007, and was officially inaugurated on the night of 30 June ? 1 July 2007. In 2008 it was awarded the German Bridge Construction Prize (Deutscher Brückenbaupreis).

Book of Elchasai
The Book of Elchasai or the Book of Elxai is a lost prophetic book containing certain laws and apocalyptic prophecies pertaining to Jewish Christian and gnostic doctrines written during the reign of Trajan. It's known only from fragments quoted in the early Christian writings of Hippolytus of Rome, Eusebius, Epiphanius of Salamis, and Origen.[1] The book was used by a number of Transjordanian sects, including Ebionites, Essenes, Nazarenes, and especially by Elcesaites whom based their origins from.[a]

It's known only from fragments quoted in the early Christian writings of Hippolytus of Rome, Eusebius, Epiphanius of Salamis, and Origen.[1] The book was used by a number of Transjordanian sects, including Ebionites, Essenes, Nazarenes, and especially by Elcesaites whom based their origins from.[a] Contents 1 Content 2 History 3 Mani 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References 6.1 Citations 7 Bibliography Content[edit] According to Hippolytus's Refutation of All Heresies, the Book of Elchasai was the source of a number of Elcesaite beliefs and practices. It encourages following the Law (including circumcision), as well as ascetic practices. Sexual desire is presented as wickedness, but a sin that could be cured through baptism. The book uses numbers and measures to foretell the future and further advocates healing rituals, as well as following a schedule based on astrology. The universe is held to be governed by principles created by God, who is called "the great and most high God". God's son (Christ, also called "the mighty king") along with the Holy Spirit (who is female) are depicted as angels of enormous size. Christ is held to have lived on earth repeatedly through reincarnation, sometimes arriving through virgin births. However, Jesus is taught to have been conceived naturally. Seven witnesses are called to confirm the teachings of Elchasai.[b] The book is also apocalyptic, expatiating on an impending crisis.[4] History[edit] The Book of Elchasai was written around the Parthian War of 114-117 AD in Aramaic by a Mesopotamian Jew.[2] The purpose of the book may have been to bring comfort to Jews surviving the massacre during the war. The book describes angelic beings of "stupendous" size and their announcement of universal destruction. These beings revealed the requirements which would allow absolution on the judgment day. Similar enormous angels are also described in 3 Enoch such as Metatron, but Elchasai is particularly describing Christ and the Holy Spirit.[5][6] The book contains a prediction of a war among wicked angels. Over hundred years later, a Hellenistic version of this manuscript was used by Syrian Judeo-Christians. Epiphananius considered this book heretical.[2][7] Alcibiades of Apamea was described by Hippolytus as a "strange demon" having possession of this book of revelations. Hippolytus refuted Alcibiades claims that the book was "a secret writing" and those who listened to the message of the book would receive remission of all their sins. The actual contents of the book were only revealed to converts, those who are willing to follow Alcibiades.[2][7] Mani[edit] Elchasai is considered to be a historical figure. The Kit?b al-Fihrist references a manuscript, written by Muslim scholar Ibn al-Nadim in which he identifies Elchasai instituting the Babylonian baptists sect of Mughtasilah (practitioners of ablution) or katharioi.[5][8] This sect was based upon the revelations that he had in his twenties. One of the followers of Elchasai was Mani, who joined Elchasai when he was only four years old by his father who was a convert to the Mughtasilah sect.[5] Mani went on to form his own Gnostic sect known as the Manicheans.[8] See also[edit] Gnostic Gospels Notes[edit] ^ Luomanen highlights the later adoption of the book by Ebionites as evidence that the book contained teachings favorable to the Ebionites, and further argues that their adoption of the book marks a distinct separation from Judaism.[2] ^ The seven witnesses are identified as heaven, water, the holy spirits (plural), the angels of prayer, oil, salt, and earth.[3] References[edit] Citations[edit] ^ Aune 2003, p. 145. ^ a b c d Luomanen 2011, pp. 42–44, 49. ^ Broadhead 2010, p. 215. ^ Broadhead 2010, pp. 214 & 215. ^ a b c Yuri 2000, p. 102. ^ Schäfer 2011, pp. 313 & 315. ^ a b Luttikhuizen 1987, pp. 101–6. ^ a b Klijn & Reinink 1974, pp. 277–289.

Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians
The Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians is a federally recognized tribe of Chumash, an indigenous people of California, in Santa Barbara.[3] Their name for themselves is Samala.[4]

They are governed by a democratically elected, five-member tribal council. Their current tribal administration is as follows: Chairman: Kenneth Kahn Vice Chairman: Raul Armenta Secretary/Treasurer: Gary Pace Business Committee Member: Mike Lopez Business Committee Member: Maxine Littlejohn.[5] Reservation[edit] The Santa Ynez Indian Reservation (34°36?10?N 120°05?29?W? / ?34.60278°N 120.09139°W? / 34.60278; -120.09139) is the only Chumash reservation.[2] It was 127-acres large and was established on 27 December 1901.[3] Beginning in 1979, the tribe established a housing program and began improving the infrastructure on the reservation.[6] Samala Chumash language[edit] The last native speaker of the Samala Chumash language, also called Ineseño, died in 1965. As of 2010, there has been a renaissance of Chumash pride and identity, including efforts to revive Samala and other Chumash languages. In the early 1900s linguist/ethnographer John P. Harrington worked with Maria Solares, one of the last fluent speakers of Samala. He created manuscripts containing information on Chumash language, culture, and traditions. Dr. Richard Applegate, who received a Ph.D. in linguistics from U.C. Berkeley, used these manuscripts to write an extensive grammar of Samala and compile a dictionary of the language, which was released in 2008.[7] Dr. Applegate and Nakia Zavalla, the Cultural Director for the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash and a direct descendant of Maria Solares, have begun an effort to revitalize the language. Applegate began teaching Samala in 2003, and Zavalla has spearheaded an immersion-based language apprentice program.[8] As of 2008, Applegate had five language apprentices; however, none had yet reached full fluency.[9] An online Samala Chumash tutorial is available.[10] Economic development[edit] The Santa Ynez Band owns and operate the Chumash Casino and Resort, as well as the Chumash Cafe, The Willows restaurant, and the Creekside Buffet, all in Santa Ynez, California. There has been multiple lawsuits against the Chumash in recent years, including a suit that was filed April 3, 2015 that claims the property where they are building their 12 story high rise hotel/casino is not part of their "Federal Tribal Trust Land" and has never been.[11] Notes[edit] ^ "Our Tribal Community."

John McLaren Park
John McLaren Park is a park in south-eastern San Francisco. John McLaren Park is the second largest park in San Francisco after Golden Gate Park. The park is surrounded mostly by the Excelsior, Crocker-Amazon, Visitacion Valley, Portola and University Mound neighborhoods.
For the suburb of Auckland, see McLaren Park, New Zealand. John McLaren Park McNab Lake with Playground Type Municipal (San Francisco) Location San Francisco Area 317 acres (1.28 km2; 0.495 sq mi) Created 1926 Status Open all year John McLaren Park is a park in south-eastern San Francisco. John McLaren Park is the second largest park in San Francisco after Golden Gate Park. The park is surrounded mostly by the Excelsior, Crocker-Amazon, Visitacion Valley, Portola and University Mound neighborhoods. Contents 1 History 2 Amenities 3 See also 4 External links 5 References History[edit] John McLaren Park was once a part of Rancho Cañada de Guadalupe la Visitación y Rodeo Viejo. When California was part of Mexico, its then governor Juan Bautista Alvarado granted what is now known as John McLaren Park to the local authorities in 1840. In 1905, subdivisions of the land grant were drawn up and Daniel Burnham recommended that the land where John McLaren Park is today be a park. The land was purchased by the Board of Supervisors in 1928 despite a bond measure being defeated. In 1934, John McLaren organized a dedication flag ceremony in the park, which bears his name, and it is currently the second-largest park in the city. Amenities[edit] Coffman Pool was John McLaren Park's first recreation facility constructed near Herz Playground, also in John McLaren Park in 1958. A master plan for the park was published in 1959 which called for the creation of more recreational facilities. Construction of the facilities included in the Master Plan (The Gleneagles Golf Course, McNab Lake, Louis Sutter, Herz, and Mansfield-Burrows Playground, the Wilde Overlook, and the amphitheater—later to be renamed the Jerry Garcia Amphitheater) began in the 1960s, and also included new trails, picnic and parking areas, community gardens, and an irrigation system. In the northeast corner of the park is Yosemite Marsh, a habitat for native species that include the forktail damselfly and flowering quillwort. Named a "significant natural resource area" by the city in 1995, the marsh marks the origin of Yosemite Creek, a body of water that flows through underground culverts towards Candlestick Point.[1] See also[edit] San Francisco Bay Area portal Jerry Garcia Amphitheatre External links[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to McLaren Park, San Francisco.

Douglas B. McKelway (born 1954) is a television journalist who serves as a general assignment reporter for the Washington, D.C. bureau of the Fox News Channel. He joined the network in November 2010.[1] McKelway previously worked at the Washington D.C. ABC affiliate WJLA-TV. He was born and raised in Washington D.C.[2] His grandfather, Benjamin M. McKelway, was editor of the Washington Evening Star newspaper and President of the Associated Press. His father, William Prentiss McKelway, was an obstetrician and a clinical professor at George Washington University Hospital.[3] McKelway graduated from the Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Skidmore College.[1] Contents 1 Broadcast career 2 Personal life 3 References 4 External links Broadcast career[edit] McKelway's first television news job was in Charlotte, North Carolina at WPCQ-TV (now WCNC-TV) from 1980 to 1982. He also worked in Kansas, Missouri and Florida, before returning to Washington. He was a reporter and news anchor with WRC-TV until October 2001, when he joined WJLA-TV. On May 13, 2009, as co-host of Washington, DC's Let's Talk Live on local cable's TBD TV (Formerly News Channel 8), McKelway conducted a live interview with blogger Michael Rogers where they discussed Rogers' efforts to "out" secretly gay politicians who oppose gay rights. At one point, McKelway told Rogers, "I'd take you outside and give you a punch across the face... I think you're hurting innocent people."[2][4] In July 2010, McKelway provided live coverage for the noon newscast of a rally by religious and environmental groups that were protesting BP's response to the Gulf oil spill. McKelway made comments regarding BP's contributions to Democratic President Barack Obama. After the broadcast, McKelway met with WJLA Station Manager Bill Lord, who objected to the BP contribution facts being divulged in the live report, and following a heated exchange, McKelway was suspended from his reporting duties as well as anchoring the early-morning Good Morning, Washington news show.[2] The Washington Post later reported on September 17, 2010, that McKelway had been dismissed.[5] Since his firing he has been hired by Fox News Channel for which he is now a reporter.[1] During the Thanksgiving Holidays in 2013, McKelway substituted for Brett Baier on Fox News' Special Report, giving him exposure amongst the large early-evening Fox audience.

Telugu (English pronunciation: /?t?l??u?/;[5] ?????? telugu, IPA: [t?el?u?u]) is a Dravidian language native to India. It stands alongside Hindi, English and Bengali as one of the few languages that predominate in more than one Indian state;[6] it is the primary language in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and in the town of Yanam, Puducherry. It is also spoken by significant minorities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry, and by the Sri Lankan Gypsy people. It is one of six languages designated a classical language of India by the Government of India.[7][8] Telugu ranks third by the number of native speakers in India (74 million, 2001 census),[9] fifteenth in the Ethnologue list of most-spoken languages worldwide[10] and is the most widely spoken Dravidian language. It is one of the twenty-two scheduled languages of the Republic of India.[11] Telugu language is offered as a course in the University of California, Berkeley[12] In loans from Sanskrit, Telugu retains some of the features that have subsequently been lost in some of Sanskrit's daughter languages such as Hindi and Bengali, especially in the pronunciation of some vowels and consonants.[13] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Earliest records 2.2 Post-Ikshvaku period 2.3 Middle Ages 2.4 Vijayanagara Empire 2.5 Delhi Sultanate and Mughal influence 2.6 Colonial period 2.7 Post-independence period 3 Dialects 3.1 Geographic distribution 4 Phonology 4.1 Vowels 4.2 Consonants 5 Grammar 5.1 Inflection 5.2 Gender 5.3 Pronouns 6 Vocabulary 7 Writing system 7.1 Number system 7.2 Script 8 Literature 9 Telugu support on digital devices 10 See also 11 References 12 Bibliography 13 External links Etymology[edit] The etymology of Telugu is not known for certain. It has been documented by historians to have been derived from trilinga, as in Trilinga Desa, "the country of the three lingas". According to a Hindu legend, Shiva descended as a linga on three mountains: Kaleswaram in Naizam, Srisailam in Rayalaseema and Bhimeswaram in Kostha; these marked the boundaries of the Telugu country.[14][15]Srikakulam in Krishna District on the banks of Krishna River was the first capital of Trilinga Desa and was ruled by the divine ruler Andhra Vishnu. Sri Krishnadevaraya visited his temple in Srikakulam (Krishna District) which is about 50 km from Vijayawada and paid homage to the deity. It was here that Raya wrote the literary classic, Amuktamalyada at the order of the Lord Andhra Vishnu who had said "dESa BhAShalandu telugu lessa" and ordered Sri Krishnadevaraya to adopt Telugu as the official language of his province. There is another view that tenugu is derived from the proto-dravidian word ten[16] (which means south) to mean "The people who lived in the south/southern direction". This seems likely because there are similar names to other dravidian languages : baDaga, koDagu, vaDugar ( a name for the telugu-speaking people given by people in Tamil Nadu, meaning : People who are in the north (relatively)). The name telugu then, is a result of 'n' -> 'l' alternation established in Telugu.[17] History[edit] According to the Russian linguist Andronov, Telugu split from Proto-Dravidian languages between 1500 and 1000 BC.[18][19] Earliest records[edit] Bhimeswaram Srisailam Kaleswaram Locations of Trilinga Kshetras Inscriptions with Telugu words dating back to 400 BC to 100 BC have been discovered in Bhattiprolu in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh.[20] The English translation of one inscription reads, "gift of the slab by venerable Midikilayakha".[21][22][23] Post-Ikshvaku period[edit] Main article: Early Telugu epigraphy The period from 575 AD to 1022 AD corresponds to the second phase of Telugu history, after the Andhra Ikshvaku period. This is evidenced by the first inscription that is entirely in Telugu, dated 575 AD, which was found in the Rayalaseema region and is attributed to the Renati Cholas, who broke with the prevailing custom of using Sanskrit and began writing royal proclamations in the local language. During the next fifty years, Telugu inscriptions appeared in Anantapuram and other neighboring regions.[citation needed] Telugu was more influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit during this period, which corresponded to the advent of Telugu literature. Telugu literature was initially found in inscriptions and poetry in the courts of the rulers, and later in written works such as Nannayya's Mahabharatam (1022 AD).[24] During the time of Nannayya, the literary language diverged from the popular language. It was also a period of phonetic changes in the spoken language. Middle Ages[edit] The third phase is marked by further stylization and sophistication of the literary language. During this period the split of the Telugu and Kannada alphabets took place.[25] Tikkana wrote his works in this script. Vijayanagara Empire[edit] The Vijayanagara Empire gained dominance from 1336 to the late 17th century, reaching its peak during the rule of Krishnadevaraya in the 16th century, when Telugu literature experienced what is considered its Golden Age.[24] Telugu script on Copper plates, Eastern Chalukya, 10th century AD. Delhi Sultanate and Mughal influence[edit] With the exception of Coastal Andhra[citation needed], a distinct dialect developed in the Telangana State and the parts of Rayalaseema region due to Persian/Arabic influence: Sultanate rule under the Tughlaq dynasty had been established earlier in the northern Deccan during the 14th century. In the latter half of the 17th century, Mughal rule extended further south, culminating in the establishment of the princely state of Hyderabad by the Asaf Jah dynasty in 1724. This heralded an era of Persian/Arabic influence on the Telugu language, especially among the people of Hyderabad. The effect is also evident in the prose of the early 19th century, as in the Kaifiyats.[24] In the princely state of Nizam, Andhra Jana Sangham was started in 1921 with the main intention of promoting Telugu language, literature, its books and historical research led by Madapati Hanumantha Rao (Founder of Andhra Jana Sangham), Komarraju Venkata Lakshmana Rao (Founder of Library Movement in Hyderabad State), Suravaram Pratapareddy and others. Colonial period[edit] The 16th-century Venetian explorer Niccolò de' Conti, who visited the Vijayanagara Empire, found that the words in Telugu language end with vowels, just like those in Italian, and hence referred it as "The Italian of the East";[26] a saying that has been widely repeated.[27] In the period of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries saw the influence of the English language and modern communication/printing press as an effect of the British rule, especially in the areas that were part of the Madras Presidency. Literature from this time had a mix of classical and modern traditions and included works by scholars like Kandukuri Veeresalingam, Gurazada Apparao and Panuganti Lakshminarasimha Rao.[24] Since the 1930s, what was considered an elite literary form of the Telugu language, has now spread to the common people with the introduction of mass media like movies, television, radio and newspapers. This form of the language is also taught in schools and colleges as a standard. Post-independence period[edit] Telugu is one of the 22 official languages of India. The Andhra Pradesh Official Language Act, 1966, declares Telugu the official language of the state that is currently divided into Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. This enactment was implemented by GOMs No 420 in 2005.[28][29] Telugu also has official language status in the Yanam District of the Union Territory of Puducherry. Telugu, along with Kannada, was declared as one of the classical languages of India in the year 2008. The fourth World Telugu Conference was organized in Tirupati city in the last week of December 2012 and deliberated at length on issues related to Telugu development Telugu is the third most spoken native language in India after Hindi and Bengali. Dialects[edit] There are two main dialects Telangana telugu spoken mainly in Telanagana and Andhra telugu spoken in Andhra Pradesh. Waddar, Chenchu, and Manna-Dora are all closely related to Telugu.[30] Dialects of Telugu are Berad, Dasari, Dommara, Golari, Kamathi, Komtao, Konda-Reddi, Salewari, Vadaga, Srikakula, Vishakhapatnam, East Godaveri, Rayalseema, Nellore, Guntur, Vadari and Yanadi.[31] In Karnataka the dialect sees more influence of Kannada and is a bit different than what is spoken in Andhra. There are significant populations of Telugu speakers in the eastern districts of Karnataka viz. Bangalore Urban, Bellary, Chikballapur, Kolar. In Tamil Nadu the Telugu dialect is classified into Salem, Coimbatore, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai and Madras Telugu dialects. It is also spoken in pockets of Virudhunagar, Tuticorin, Tirunelveli, Madurai, Theni, Madras(Chennai) and Thanjavur districts. Geographic distribution[edit] See also: States of India by Telugu speakers Geographic distribution of Telugu speakers in India. Telugu is natively spoken in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and Yanam district of Puducherry. Telugu speaking migrants are also found in the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, some parts of Jharkhand and the Kharagpur region of West Bengal in India. At 7.2% of the population, Telugu is the third-most-spoken language in the Indian subcontinent after Hindi and Bengali. In Karnataka, 7.0% of the population speak Telugu, and 5.6% in Tamil Nadu, where it commonly known as Telungu.[32] Telugu diaspora numbers more than 800,000,[citation needed] with the highest concentration in United States, Central New Jersey; as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Bahrain, Canada, Fiji, Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius, Myanmar, Ireland, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, as well as other western European countries, where there are also a considerable Telugu diaspora.[citation needed] Phonology[edit] Telugu words generally end in vowels. In Old Telugu, this was absolute; in the modern language m, n, y, w may end a word. Atypically for a Dravidian language, voiced consonants were distinctive even in the oldest recorded form of the language. Sanskrit loans have introduced aspirated and murmured consonants as well. Telugu does not have contrastive stress, and speakers vary on where they perceive stress. Most judge it to be on the penultimate or final syllable, depending on word and vowel length.[33] Vowels[edit] Telugu features a form of vowel harmony wherein the second vowel in disyllabic noun and adjective roots alters according to whether the first vowel is tense or lax.[34][need illustrations] Also, if the second vowel is open (i.e. /a?/ or /a/), then the first vowel will be more open and centralized (e.g. [m??ka] 'goat', as opposed to [me?ku] 'nail').[citation needed] Telugu words also have vowels in inflectional suffixes that are harmonized with the vowels of the preceding syllable.[35] Vowels – ??????? acchulu ? i ? i? ? u ? u? ? e ? e? ? o ? o? æ? ? a ? a? /æ?/ only occurs in loan words. Telugu has two diphthongs: ? [ai] and ? [au]. Consonants[edit] The table below illustrates the articulation of the consonants.[36] Telugu consonants Bilabial Labiodental Denti- alveolar Retroflex "Palatal" Velar Plosive tenuis /p/ ? pa /t?/ ? ta /?/ ? ?a /t??/ ? ca /k/ ? ka voiced /b/ ? ba /d?/ ? da /?/ ? ?a /d??/ ? ja /?/ ? ga aspirated* /p?/ ? pha /t??/ ? tha /??/ ? ?ha /t???/ ? cha /k?/ ? kha breathy voiced* /b?/ ? bha /d??/ ? dha /??/ ? ?ha /d???/ ? jha /??/ ? gha Nasal /m/ ? ma /n?/ ? na /?/ ? ?a Fricative* /f/ /s?/ ? sa /?/ ? ?a /?/ ? ?a /x/ ? ha Approximant central /?/ ? va /j/ ? ya lateral /l?/ ? la /?/ ? ?a Flap /r?/ *The aspirated and breathy-voiced consonants occur mostly in loan words, as do the fricatives apart from native /s?/. Grammar[edit] Main article: Telugu grammar The Telugu Grammar is called vy?karanam (????????). The first treatise on Telugu grammar, the Andhra Sabda Chintamani, was written in Sanskrit by Nannayya, considered the first Telugu poet and translator, in the 11th century AD. This grammar followed the patterns which existed in grammatical treatises such as A???dhy?y? and V?lm?kivy?karanam, but unlike P??ini, Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering samjn?, sandhi, ajanta, halanta and kriya. Every Telugu grammatical rule is derived from P??inian concepts. In the 19th century, Chinnaya Suri wrote a simplified work on Telugu grammar called B?la Vy?karanam, borrowing concepts and ideas from Nannayya's grammar. Sentence ???? ????? ????????. Words ???? ????? ????????. Transliteration r?mu ba?iki ve?t??u Gloss Ramu to school goes. Parts Subject Object Verb Translation Ramu goes to school. This sentence can also be interpreted as 'Ramu will go to school', depending on the context, but it does not affect the SOV order. Inflection[edit] Telugu nouns are inflected for number (singular, plural), gender (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and case (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, vocative, instrumental, and locative).[37] Gender[edit] Telugu has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Pronouns[edit] Telugu pronouns include personal pronouns (the persons speaking, the persons spoken to, or the persons or things spoken about). Indefinite pronouns, relative pronouns (connecting parts of sentences) and reciprocal or reflexive pronouns (in which the object of a verb is being acted on by the verb's subject). Telugu uses the same forms for singular feminine and neuter gender—the third person pronoun (??? /ad??/) is used to refer to animals and objects.[38][39] The nominative case (karta), the object of a verb (karma), and the verb are somewhat in a sequence in Telugu sentence construction. "Vibhakti" (case of a noun) and "pratyayamulu" (an affix to roots and words forming derivatives and inflections) depict the ancient nature and progression of the language. The "Vibhaktis" of Telugu language " ?? [Du], ?? [mu], ?? [vu], ?? [lu]", etc., are different from those in Sanskrit and have been in use for a long time. Vocabulary[edit] Sanskrit influenced Telugu of Andhra and Telangana regions for about 1500 years; however, there is evidence that suggests an older influence. During the period 1000–1100 AD, Nannaya's re-writing of the Mah?bh?rata in Telugu (?????????) re-established its use, and it dominated over the royal language, Sanskrit. Telugu absorbed tatsamas from Sanskrit.[40] The vocabulary of Telugu, especially in Telangana state, has a trove of Persian–Arabic borrowings, which have been modified to fit Telugu phonology. This was due to centuries of Muslim rule in these regions, such as the erstwhile kingdoms of Golkonda and Hyderabad (e.g. ?????, /kaburu/ for Urdu /xabar/, ??? or ?????, /d?ava?bu/ for Urdu /d?aw??b/, ????). Modern Telugu vocabulary can be said to constitute a diglossia because the formal, standardized version of the language is either lexically Sanskrit or heavily influenced by Sanskrit, is taught in schools, and is used by the government and Hindu religious institutions. However, everyday Telugu varies depending upon region and social status. Writing system[edit] The name Telugu written in the Telugu script Main articles: Telugu script and Telugu Braille Telugu script is written from left to right and consists of sequences of simple and/or complex characters. The script is syllabic in nature—the basic units of writing are syllables. Since the number of possible syllables is very large, syllables are composed of more basic units such as vowels (“achchu” or “swaram”) and consonants (“hallu” or “vyanjanam”). Consonants in consonant clusters take shapes that are very different from the shapes they take elsewhere. Consonants are presumed to be pure consonants, that is, without any vowel sound in them. However, it is traditional to write and read consonants with an implied 'a' vowel sound. When consonants combine with other vowel signs, the vowel part is indicated orthographically using signs known as vowel “maatras”. The shapes of vowel “maatras” are also very different from the shapes of the corresponding vowels. The overall pattern consists of sixty symbols, of which 16 are vowels, three vowel modifiers, and forty-one consonants. Spaces are used between words as word separators. The sentence ends with either a single bar ? (“purna viramam”) or a double bar ? (“deergha viramam”). Traditionally, in handwriting, Telugu words were not separated by spaces. Modern punctuation (commas, semicolon, etc.) were introduced with the advent of print.[41] There is a set of symbols for numerals, though Arabic numbers are typically used. Telugu is assigned Unicode codepoints: 0C00-0C7F (3072–3199).[42] Number system[edit] Numeral systems Hindu–Arabic numeral system Western Arabic Eastern Arabic Bengali Gurmukhi Indian Sinhala Tamil Balinese Burmese Dzongkha Javanese Khmer Lao Mongolian Thai East Asian Chinese Suzhou Hokkien Japanese Korean Vietnamese Counting rods Alphabetic Abjad Armenian ?ryabha?a Cyrillic Ge'ez Georgian Greek Hebrew Roman Former Aegean Attic Babylonian Brahmi Egyptian Etruscan Inuit Kharosthi Mayan Muisca Quipu Prehistoric Positional systems by base 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 12 16 20 60 Non-standard positional numeral systems Bijective numeration (1) Signed-digit representation (Balanced ternary) factorial negative Complex-base system (2i) Non-integer representation (?) mixed List of numeral systems v t e Telugu has its own digits, as shown below.

It first shows the painted party symbols of all the major political parties in the region during the nationwide elections in India in 2014. It also has a Telugu inscription showing availability of political flags, banners, caps, badges and other election material. The Telugu script is an abugida consisting of 60 symbols – 16 vowels, 3 vowel modifiers, and 41 consonants. The Sanskrit and Telugu scripts are similar and exhibit one-to-one correspondence. Telugu has a complete set of letters that follow a system to express sounds.[43] Some are introduced to express fine shades of difference in sounds.[43] Telugu has full-zero (anusv?ra) ( ? ), half-zero (arthanusv?ra or candrabindu) (?) and visarga ( ? ) to convey various shades of nasal sounds. la and La, ra and Ra are differentiated.[43] Telugu has .CH and .JH which are not represented in Sanskrit; their pronunciation is similar to the s sound in the word treasure (i.e. the postalveolar voiced fricative) and z sound in zebra (i.e. the alveolar voiced fricative), respectively. The Telugu script can reproduce the full range of Sanskrit phonetics without losing any of the text's originality.[43] Telugu has made its letters expressive of all the sounds and hence it has to deal with significant borrowings from Sanskrit, Tamil and Hindustani.[43] Consonants – hallulu (???????)

Literature[edit] Main article: Telugu literature Telugu literature is generally divided into six periods: In the Telugu literature Tikkana was given agraasana (top position) by many famous critics. In the earliest period there were only inscriptions from 575 AD onwards. Nannaya's (1022–1063) translation of the Sanskrit Mahabharata into Telugu is the earliest piece of Telugu literature as yet discovered. After the demise of Nannaya, there was a kind of social and religious revolution in the Telugu country.[44] Tikkana (13th century) and Yerrapragada (14th century) continued the translation of the Mahabharata started by Nannaya. Telugu poetry also flourished in this period, especially in the time of Srinatha. During this period, some Telugu poets translated Sanskrit poems and dramas, while others attempted original narrative poems. The popular Telugu literary form called the Prabandha evolved during this period. Srinatha (1365–1441) was the foremost poet, who popularized this style of composition (a story in verse having a tight metrical scheme). Srinatha's Sringara Naishadham is particularly well known. The Ramayana poets may also be referred in this context. The earliest Ramayana in Telugu is generally known as the Ranganatha Ramayana, authored by the chief Gona Buddha Reddy. The works of Pothana (1450–1510), Jakkana (second half of the 14th century) and Gaurana (first half of the 15th century) formed a canon of religious poetry during this period. Padakavitha Pithamaha – Annamayya, contributed many original Telugu Paatalu (Songs) to the language. The 16th and 17th centuries is regarded as the "golden age" of Telugu literature. Krishnadevaraya's Amuktamalyada, and Pedhdhana's Manucharithra are regarded as Mahaakaavyaas. Sri Krishnadeva Raya stated in his work Amuktamalyada that, Sri Andhra Vishnu (Srikaku?andhra Mahavi?h?u), the earlier Telugu King of Krishna river region (whom later the people believed to be an Ansh of Lord Vishnu), appeared to him in his dreams and stated that : "Desa bhashalandu Telugu Lessa" meaning "Telugu is the best among the languages of the nation". Telugu literature flourished in the south in the traditional "samsthanas" (centres) of Southern literature, such as Madurai and Tanjore. This age is often referred to as the Southern Period. There were also an increasing number of poets in this period among the ruling class, women and working class who popularised indigenous (desi) meters. With the conquest of the Deccan by the Mughals in 1687, Telugu literature entered a lull. Tyagaraja's compositions are some of the known works from this period. Then emerged a period of transition (1850–1910), followed by a long period of Renaissance. Europeans like C.P. Brown played an important role in the development of Telugu language and literature. In common with the rest of India, Telugu literature of this period was increasingly influenced by European literary forms like the novel, short story, prose and drama. Paravastu Chinnayya Soori (1807–1861) is a well-known Telugu writer who dedicated his entire life to the progress and promotion of Telugu language and literature. Sri Chinnayasoori wrote the Bala Vyakaranam in a new style after doing extensive research on Telugu grammar. Other well-known writings by Chinnayasoori are Neethichandrika, Sootandhra Vyaakaranamu, Andhra Dhatumoola, and Neeti Sangrahamu. Kandukuri Veeresalingam (1848–1919) is generally considered the father of modern Telugu literature.[45] His novel Rajasekhara Charitamu was inspired by the Vicar of Wakefield. His work marked the beginning of a dynamic of socially conscious Telugu literature and its transition to the modern period, which is also part of the wider literary renaissance that took place in Indian culture during this period. Other prominent literary figures from this period are Gurajada Appa Rao, Viswanatha Satyanarayana, Gurram Jashuva, Rayaprolu Subba Rao, Devulapalli Krishnasastri and Srirangam Srinivasa Rao, popularly known as Mahakavi Sri Sri. Sri Sri was instrumental in popularising free verse in spoken Telugu (vaaduka bhasha), as opposed to the pure form of written Telugu used by several poets in his time. Devulapalli Krishnasastri is often referred to as the Shelley of Telugu literature because of his pioneering works in Telugu Romantic poetry. Viswanatha Satyanarayana won India's national literary honour, the Jnanpith Award for his magnum opus Ramayana Kalpavrikshamu.[46] C. Narayana Reddy won the Jnanpith Award in 1988 for his poetic work, Viswambara. Ravuri Bharadhwaja won the 3rd Jnanpith Award for Telugu literature in 2013 for Paakudu Raallu, a graphic account of life behind the screen in film industry.[47] Kanyasulkam, the first social play in Telugu by Gurajada Appa Rao, was followed by the progressive movement, the free verse movement and the Digambara style of Telugu verse. Other modern Telugu novelists include Unnava Lakshminarayana (Maalapalli), Bulusu Venkateswarulu (Bharatiya Tatva Sastram), Kodavatiganti Kutumba Rao and Buchi Babu. Telugu support on digital devices[edit] Telugu input, display, and support was initially provided on the Windows platform. Subsequently, various browsers, office applications, operating systems, and user interfaces were localized for Windows and Linux platforms by vendors and free and open source volunteers. Telugu-capable smart phones were also introduced by vendors in 2013.[48] See also[edit] Telangana portal Languages portal Andhra Pradesh portal Telugu language day Telugu people Telugu grammar List of Indian languages by total speakers List of Telugu-language television channels States of India by Telugu speakers Telugu language policy References[edit] ^ Mikael Parkvall, "Världens 100 största språk 2007" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), in Nationalencyklopedin ^ Telugu at Ethnologue (14th ed., 2000). ^ Hammarström, Harald; Forkel, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin; Bank, Sebastian, eds.

Dunwoody College of Technology
Dunwoody College of Technology is a private, non-profit vocational college in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Dunwoody College of Technology Type Private, Vocational College Established 1914 President Rich Wagner, Ph.D. Address 818 Dunwoody Boulevard Minneapolis, MN 55403-1192, Minneapolis, MN, USA 44°58?21?N 93°17?25?W? / ?44.97250°N 93.29028°W? / 44.97250; -93.29028Coordinates: 44°58?21?N 93°17?25?W? / ?44.97250°N 93.29028°W? / 44.97250; -93.29028 Campus Urban, 15 acres (6.1 ha) Dunwoody College Carlson Commons Dunwoody College of Technology is a private, non-profit vocational college in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In addition to associate 2-year college programs Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.), Dunwoody also offers a Bachelor of Science in Applied Management for students with an associate degree. Dunwoody offers programs and courses in Drafting and Estimating, Interior Design, Computer Networking, Programming, Electrical, Automotive Mechanics, Heating / Air Conditioning Systems Design, Food Science Technology, Electronics, Automated Systems and Robotics, Machine Tooling, Industrial Controls, Land Surveying, Construction Management, Graphic Design, Appliance Service and Printing, and Welding. Dunwoody Institute was founded in 1914, when Minneapolis businessman William Hood Dunwoody left three million dollars in his will to "provide for all time a place where youth without distinction on account of race, color or religious prejudice, may learn the useful trades and crafts, and thereby fit themselves for the better performance of life's duties."[1] When his widow, Kate L. Dunwoody, died a year later she left additional funds to keep the college moving forward. In the spring of 1916, the Dunwoody Trustees purchased six city blocks, 3 long and 2 deep, facing the parade grounds. The Minneapolis City Council closed the streets and alleys that traversed the area creating a site of approximately 16 acres (6.5 ha). Hewitt and Brown Architects and Engineers were contracted to design a school building. Their draft included nine buildings which were composed of six shop buildings and a three-story administration facility with an auditorium on one side and a gymnasium building on the other. Three years from the school’s inception, the first two buildings were opened in August 1917 and have remained throughout the century. In issues of the Artisan from this period, the Minneapolis Public Library had one of its branches on the campus offering its services the campus’s students. Located across from St. Mary’s Basilica and Loring Park, just west of downtown, the new facility was dedicated on October 31, 1917 and the space at the Minneapolis Central High School facility was left empty. Dr. Marion L. Burton, president of the University of Minnesota, gave the address. Dr. Prosser’s commencement address in May 1918 contrasted the new facility with the old one used in cooperation with the Minneapolis school district, “Roughly four years ago we were quartered in an old, tumble-down building that, with the kindness of the board of education, served us well in time of need.” [2] When the University of Minnesota perceived its need for preparing instructors to teach in this new emerging area of vocational education, they began to look for partnerships. On April 22, 1920, Fred Snyder, President of the University of Minnesota, entered into a cooperative agreement with William Hood Dunwoody Institute allowing students who were enrolled at the University in teacher training courses to spend a portion of their class time at the institute to receive experiences related to observations and practice of all types of trade and industrial education. The reciprocity of this agreement allowed Dunwoody instructors to enroll and receive credit for any courses offered by the College of Education at the University that were a part of the teacher training authorized by the Smith Hughes Act. These matriculations were considered scholarships and did not encumber the University or the Institute in monetary exchanges, only the awarding of credits. There were no other recognizable post-secondary technical institutes or colleges at this time in the state of Minnesota. In 1953, the era of the international perspective of Dunwoody Industrial Institute became manifest when Dunwoody was provided a grant by the Ford Foundation for the purpose of sending representatives to consult with the Indonesian Ministry of Education. Under the leadership of Dunwoody Industrial Institute’s second Director J. R. Kingman, an Indonesian Technical Teacher Training Institute was to be established in Ban dung, Java. An American, Dr. Milton G Towner was the advisor and director for the center. He was on leave as director of the Staff College of the Federal Civil Defense Administration in Washington, DC. Six American teachers from Dunwoody were sent with Dr. Towner to work with indigenous Indonesians in making training available to prospective and interested teachers in the Indonesian technical school system. Seven Indonesian teachers were sent to Dunwoody for training so they could return and support the efforts being directed by Dr. Towner. On November 27, 1953, Dr. K. Nagaraja Rao, a graduate of the University of Mysore, India, became the head of Dunwoody Industrial Institute’s new International Services Division. He was a native of India who taught at the Illinois Institute of Technology and the Korean Technical Institute, where he opened a department of chemical engineering. His job was to be the liaison between the Indonesia project and the Ford Foundation. Since 1951, he had been a consultant to the Government of Indonesia for the development of indigenous industries. Mr. Phillip S. Van Wyck became the senior advisor of the Government Technical Institute in Insein, Burma. The development and operation of this government Technical Institute was funded by the Ford Foundation and assisted with staffing from Dunwoody. In 1956, Dunwoody Industrial Institute began its third technical assistance program in the Union of Burma, establishing the first technical high school in Rangoon. In a government-sponsored building, four Dunwoody employees assisted the local Burmese in developing shops, curriculum and demonstration materials. Burmese instructors were delivered the curriculum. The Annual Report of the Ford Foundation noted Dunwoody Institute’s efforts at Insein and Rangoon. It also it noted that a second Teacher’s Institute was started in Djakarta. The Central Training Institute in Bombay India was opened in March 1963 with the assistance of a five-member team from Dunwoody, the Indian Government and the US Department of Education. In the Dunwoody News March 29, 1963 issue, a facsimile of the formal invitation indicating that Prime Minister Nehru of India would be addressing the inauguration ceremony of the Institute is found. That year another project began in Khartoum, Sudan, to establish the Khartoum Senior Trade school which opened in December 1964. Dr. Rao left Dunwoody Industrial Institute in 1965 to become a program officer for the Ford Foundation in the foundation’s Latin American program after a twelve-year tenure at the institute. Robert R. Minarik, a graduate of the Dunwoody electronics program and the University of Minnesota, replaced Rao, bringing his experience overseas from Burma and Saudi Arabia. In 1967 Dunwoody began overseas programs with funding from private industries rather than foundations or United States Government sponsorship. The first initiative was with the Alumina Partners of Jamaica known as ALPART. Contracting directly with Dunwoody Institute, they desired the institute to organize and implement a training school for construction and maintenance workers. This ALPART Training Center for Industrial Skills was to serve the ALPART aluminum plant in Nain in South Central Jamaica. A senior team of Dunwoody employees would begin to train and set in place Jamaican personnel as trainers. Time-release training aimed at select job targets were dovetailed with on- the-job training and specific customized training manuals. This partnership came to a successful conclusion in the fall of 1972. During this time, a nine-member Dunwoody team worked with Esso Standard Libya Inc at the Marsa el Brega terminal in Libya. This refinery and production complex provided an opportunity for developing curriculum for and also operating ESSO’s Industrial Training Center. Further east in Saudi Arabia, the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) began a long-term training relationship that lasted into the 80’s. New hardware and software for basic and mid-level electric and electronic training at the Ras Tanura Industrial Training shops were targeted. The curriculum developed here was transferable to two other sites: one in Dhahran and the other in Abqaiq. Freeport Indonesia Inc hired a Dunwoody team to help in their copper mining project in Irian Jaya. The objective here was to assist in the training of the indigenous Indonesian work force as electrical, mechanical, and mobile machinery operators at the town site of Tembaga Pura. These mining facilities were remote, the Indonesians were from jungle tribes, and the size of the enterprise larger than Dunwoody Institute had ever attempted before. In 2000, Dr. Jane Plihal, associate professor and chair of the Department of Work, Community and Family Education at the College of Education and Human Development reevaluated the 1920 “Cooperative Agreement Between Dunwoody Industrial Institute and the University of Minnesota.” She proposed a termination of the agreement. Plihal perceived the University’s perception of the agreement as anachronistic and no longer expressive of the ways in which the two institutions had been cooperating or could cooperate at the end of the century. A notice of termination for this agreement, signed on December 28, 2000 by Robert H Bruininks, Executive Vice President and Provost, voided the reciprocity agreement between the two institutions at the end of summer session 2001.[3] In 2003, Dunwoody Institute merged with NEI College of Technology of Columbia Heights, Minnesota, which specialized in electronics and computer technology. NEI's operations were moved to the Dunwoody campus and the old campus was sold and demolished. The combined institution was renamed Dunwoody College of Technology. In 2004, the college took decisive steps to diversify a student body that had long been almost exclusively white and male, hiring a director of diversity and increasing the percentage of students of color to 20%.[4] In 2007, the college sponsored a new charter high school in North Minneapolis, Dunwoody Academy.

A Saga-novel, overtly portraying 'empire of evil', its consequences and a long journey of Georgian society and culture, won top literary award SABA as the best novel of the year. Plot[edit] The story begins at the end of the 19th century when a Russian officer seduces a Georgian shepherd’s wife: the resulting bastard, the ancestor of the novels anti-heroes, is kept in a basket where he cannot interfere with his mother’s adultery. The shepherd avenges himself by murdering his wife and disemboweling himself, but fails to kill the boy in the basket. The boy, Razhden Kasheli, later rapes his foster-mother, before disappearing to become a robber and murderer, returning to Georgia with the Red Army and a female tramp he has married: he becomes a killer for the Soviet authorities. After he is murdered by a drunken Assyrian, his son Anton acts as a GPU and NKVD killer in the Great Terror of 1937-8, shooting countless victims. Anton’s great achievement is to marry Princess Ketusi, whose father and husband he has murdered, thus initiating the process, fatal for Georgian society, of intermarrying and interbreeding Soviet killers with Georgian aristocrats and intellectuals. Anton is killed by a runaway truck in 1949, but his son Razhden 2nd takes over as an important Soviet official. Razhden’s son Anton second may not, however, be a real Kasheli, since his mother Pepe was pregnant before the parents married. Anton is a childish dreamer and, manipulated by Razhden 2nd , marries Liziko, the daughter of an unworldly writer, Elizbar. Razhden seduces Liziko: both Anton and Elizbar find out after Liziko confesses to her stepmother. More important even than these violent sexual and homicidal events are the author’s and character’s reflections on the irrecoverable degradation of the country.[1] References[edit] ^ book.gov.ge This article about a historical novel of the 2000s is a stub.

Expressen Type Daily newspaper Format Tabloid Owner(s) Bonnier AB Editor-in-chief Thomas Mattsson Founded 1944; 72 years ago (1944) Political alignment Independent liberal Headquarters Stockholm Circulation 270,900 (2010) Website www.expressen.se Expressen is one of two nationwide evening tabloid newspapers in Sweden, the other being Aftonbladet. Expressen was founded in 1944;[1] its symbol is a wasp and slogans "it stings" or "Expressen to your rescue". Contents 1 Overview 2 Circulation 3 Kvällsposten 4 GT 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Overview[edit] The first edition of Expressen was released on 16 November 1944.[2][3] A main feature that day was an interview with the crew members of a British bomber who were successful in sinking the German ship Tirpitz. The editor in chief of Expressen is Thomas Mattsson. The paper is owned by the Bonnier Group.[4][5] As of 2005 the paper had a liberal stance,[6] but it declared its independent leaning in 1995.[2] Through mergers, the Gothenburg edition of Expressen is titled GT (originally Göteborgs-Tidningen) and the Malmö edition is titled Kvällsposten, but the three share half of the content. Expressen (with GT and Kvällsposten) maintains a centre-right political profile, describing its editorial position as "independent liberal", while the competitor Aftonbladet is social-democratic. Ownership of Expressen (and Sweden's largest morning newspaper Dagens Nyheter) is controlled by the Bonnier family, while Aftonbladet is owned jointly by Swedish trade unions and the Norwegian publishing family Schibsted. Circulation[edit] In 1998 the circulation of Expressen was 316,000 copies on weekdays and 396,000 copies on Sundays.[2] The paper had a circulation of 334,000 copies in 2001.[7] The 2004 circulation of the paper was 335,000 copies.[5] It was 339,400 copies on weekdays in 2005.[6] The 2010 circulation of the paper was 270,900 copies.[8] Kvällsposten[edit] Kvällsposten is an edition of Expressen distributed in southern Sweden. Its editorial offices are in Malmö and the editor in chief is Martin Kroon. GT[edit] Göteborgs-Tidningen or GT was a tabloid newspaper founded in Göteborg in 1902 and distributed in Western Sweden. GT was owned by Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning, but in 1973 acquired by Göteborgs-Posten. In 1998, Bonnier AB bought the newspaper and since then it has become a local edition of Expressen. GT's headquarters in Göteborg and its editor in chief is Frida Boisen.[9][10] See also[edit] List of Swedish newspapers References[edit] ^ Lennart Weibull (2013).

He is still serving at the Ministry of Internal Affairs in this position.[1] Contents 1 Early life 2 Education 3 Career 4 Politics 5 References and bibliography Early life[edit] Arafat was born in Damascus to a Palestinian couple from Nablus. He worked as a volunteer in emergency medicine from the age of 14.[2][3] In 1981 he emigrated to Romania and initially settled in Pite?ti, where he took Romanian language classes. Education[edit] Arafat enrolled at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Cluj-Napoca.[2][3] He later moved to the Târgu Mure? University of Medicine, where he underwent specialization in anesthesiology.[3][4] He completed a number of specialist courses abroad, training with the Paris Fire Brigade, the United States National Guard, and the Norwegian Air Ambulance.[4] Career[edit] Following the 1989 Revolution, Arafat contemplated leaving for France, but his application was rejected,[2] so he concentrated instead on creating an emergency service in Târgu Mure? (which he originally financed with personal funds).[2] In 1991, he created SMURD, a mobile emergency service which began collaborating with the Romanian firefighting service[2] and the Fire service of Scotland,[3] working for it as a volunteer until 1998, when he gained Romanian citizenship.[2][3] Politics[edit] In late 2005, his project to have SMURD function as an additional rescue service at a county level was passed into law, but raised opposition from the physician and Social Democratic politician Sorin Oprescu, who had drafted an alternative proposal.[5] A reference to Arafat as "the Ayatollah of Romanian emergency medicine" and the stress he placed on the latter's country of origin brought Oprescu to the attention of the National Council for Combating Discrimination.[5] [6] A first aid instructor, he coordinated international lectures on the matter in several countries (including Austria, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States).[4] In 2003, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Merit of Romania (a Grand Officer since 2005).[4] Since August, 2009, he has held the position of Under-Secretary of State for Health.[7] He resigned from this position on January 10, 2012, as he expressed criticism on the health system reform.[8] After a series of protests in several cities,[9] the government announced changes to the reform plan, and Dr Arafat returned to his post as Under-Secretary of State.[10] In late 2012 he was Romanian Minister of Health, then came back to his charge as undersecretary in the same ministry.
